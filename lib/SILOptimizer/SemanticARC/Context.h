  ///
  /// A "joined owned introducer" is a value with owned ownership whose
  /// ownership is derived from multiple non-trivial owned operands of a related
  /// instruction. Some examples are phi arguments, tuples, structs. Naturally,
  /// all of these instructions must be non-unary instructions and only have
  /// this property if they have multiple operands that are non-trivial.
  ///
  /// In such a case, we can not just treat them like normal forwarding concepts
  /// since we can only eliminate optimize such a value if we are able to reason
  /// about all of its operands together jointly. This is not amenable to a
  /// small peephole analysis.
  ///
  /// Instead, as we perform the peephole analysis, using the multimap, we map
  /// each joined owned value introducer to the set of its @owned operands that
  /// we thought we could convert to guaranteed only if we could do the same to
  /// the joined owned value introducer. Then once we finish performing
  /// peepholes, we iterate through the map and see if any of our joined phi
  /// ranges had all of their operand's marked with this property by iterating
  /// over the multimap. Since we are dealing with owned values and we know that
  /// our LiveRange can not see through joined live ranges, we know that we
  /// should only be able to have a single owned value introducer for each
  /// consumed operand.
  ///
  /// NOTE: To work around potential invalidation of our consuming operands when
  /// adding values to edges on the CFG, we store our Operands as a
  /// SILBasicBlock and an operand number. We only add values to edges and never
  /// remove/modify edges so the operand number should be safe.
