        This repository hosts the Codira compiler, the Codira standard library,
        the Codira runtime, SourceKit, and IDE support for the Codira language.
        It does *not* track feedback on Xcode and other closed source Apple
        developer software such as CodiraUI and UIKit; please direct it to
        [Feedback Assistant](https://developer.apple.com/bug-reporting)
        instead.

        ___


        Codira is guided by a community-driven process referred to as the
        [Codira evolution](https://www.code.org/language-evolution)
        process. Submitting this form is not a guarantee that the request will
        be considered or implemented. If the request implies an addition,
        removal, or change to the features of the Codira language or the public
        interface of the Codira standard library, please consider socializing it
        on the
        [Codira forums](https://forums.code.org/c/evolution/discuss)
        instead. The Codira forums are the preferred space for sharing ideas and
        discussing them with the Codira community.

        If it's completely new functionality that cannot be emulated, motivate
