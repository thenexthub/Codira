If enabled, both `#include <header.h>`-style and `#include \"header.h\"`-style directives search the paths in `USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS` before `HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`. As a consequence, user headers, such as your own `String.h` header, have precedence over system headers when using `#include <header.h>`. This is done using the `-iquote` flag for the paths provided in `USER_HEADER_SEARCH_PATHS`. If disabled and your compiler fully supports separate user paths, user headers are only accessible with `#include \"header.h\"`-style preprocessor directives.

For backwards compatibility reasons, this setting is enabled by default. Disabling it is strongly recommended.";

A symbol name may also be optionally preceded with the architecture (for example, `ppc:_foo` or `ppc:foo.o:_foo`). This enables you to have one order file that works for multiple architectures.
