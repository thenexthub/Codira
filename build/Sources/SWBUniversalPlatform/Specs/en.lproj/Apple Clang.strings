In addition, when a function is recognized as a builtin function, GCC may use information about that function to warn about problems with calls to that function, or to generate more efficient code, even if the resulting code still contains calls to that function.

Enabling increased sharing of PCH files carries some risk—if two targets use the same prefix header but have different include paths that cause the prefix header to include different files when they are precompiled, then subtle problems may result because one target will use a PCH that was built using files included by the other target.
