This Chapter describes the meanings of expressions and the rules for the
evaluation of expressions, except the expressions described as experimental (see
:ref:`Lambda Expressions with Receiver`).

.. index::
   evaluation
   expression
   lambda expression with receiver

The syntax of *expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    expression:
        primaryExpression
        | instanceOfExpression
        | castExpression
        | typeOfExpression
        | nullishCoalescingExpression
        | spreadExpression
        | unaryExpression
        | binaryExpression
        | assignmentExpression
        | ternaryConditionalExpression
        | stringInterpolation
        | lambdaExpression
        | lambdaExpressionWithReceiver
        | awaitExpression
        ;
    primaryExpression:
        literal
        | namedReference
        | arrayLiteral
        | objectLiteral
        | recordLiteral
        | thisExpression
        | parenthesizedExpression
        | methodCallExpression
        | fieldAccessExpression
        | indexingExpression
        | functionCallExpression
        | newExpression
        | ensureNotNullishExpression
        ;
    binaryExpression:
        multiplicativeExpression
        | exponentiationExpression
        | additiveExpression
        | shiftExpression
        | relationalExpression
        | equalityExpression
        | bitwiseAndLogicalExpression
        | conditionalAndExpression
        | conditionalOrExpression
        ;

.. index::
   expression
   coroutine

   syntax

The syntax below introduces several productions to be used by other
expression syntax rules:

.. code-block:: abnf

    objectReference:
        typeReference
        | 'super'
        | primaryExpression
        ;

``objectReference`` refers to one of the following three options:

- Class that is to handle static members;

- ``super`` that is to access constructors declared in the
  superclass, or the overridden method version of the superclass;

- *primaryExpression* that is to refer to a variable
  after evaluation, unless the manner of the
  evaluation is altered by the chaining operator ``'?.'`` (see
  :ref:`Chaining Operator`).

If the form of *primaryExpression* is *thisExpression*, then the pattern
``this?.`` is handled as a :index:`compile-time error`.

If the form of *primaryExpression* is *super*, then the pattern ``super?.``
is handled as a :index:`compile-time error`.

.. _Operators:

Operators
*********

An expression is a composition of an operator with its operands. Parentheses
are used to change the order of calculation.

*Operators*, or *operator signs*, are tokens that denote various actions, i.e.,
addition, subtraction, etc. (see :ref:`Operators and Punctuators`) to be
performed on the values of *operands*. Depending on the number of operands,
operators can be as follows:

- *Unary operator* has a single operand,
- *Binary operator* has two operands, and
- *Ternary operator* has three operands.

Some operators can be both unary and binary.

Each operator has *precedence* and *associativity* which are significant if
an expression has several operators:

- *Precedence* defines operator priority, i.e., the order of evaluation of
  operators with different precedence.
- *Associativity* defines the direction of evaluation (left-to-right or
  right-to-left) if several operators have the same precedence.

For example, the sum is calculated first due to the higher precedence of
``'+'``, and then assignments are processed from right to left due to the right
associativity of ``'='`` in the following chunk of code:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let a: number = 1, b: number
   b = a = a+10
   console.log(b) // prints '11'

.. note::
   The parentheses ``'( )'`` are the *grouping operator* that has the highest
   precedence and allows changing the order of expression evaluation.

The complete list of operators indicating their precedence and associativity
is provided in :ref:`Operator Precedence`.

.. _Evaluation of Expressions:

Evaluation of Expressions
*************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done
    todo: needs more investigation, too much failing CTS tests (mostly tests are buggy)

The result of a program expression *evaluation* denotes the following:

-  Variable (the term *variable* is used here in the general, non-terminological
   sense to denote a modifiable lvalue in the left-hand side of an assignment);
   or
-  Value (results found elsewhere).

.. index::
   evaluation
   expression
   variable
   lvalue
   value
   assignment

A variable or a value are equally considered the *value of the expression*
if such a value is required for further evaluation.

The type of an expression is determined at compile time (see
:ref:`Type of Expression`).

Expressions can contain assignments, increment operators, decrement operators,
method calls, and function calls. The evaluation of an expression can produce
side effects as a result.

*Constant expressions* (see :ref:`Constant Expressions`) are the expressions
with values that can be determined at compile time.

.. _Type of Expression:

Type of Expression
==================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Every expression in the |LANG| programming language has a type. The type of an
expression is determined at compile time.

In most contexts, an expression must be *compatible* with the type expected in
a context. This type is called *target type*. If no target type is available
in a context, then the expression is called a *standalone expression*:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a = expr // no target type is available

    function foo() {
        expr // no target type is available
    }

Otherwise, the expression is *non-standalone*:

.. index::
   inferred type
   expression
   evaluation
   compile time
   compatibility
   type inference
   compatible expression
   standalone expression
   non-standalone expression
   context
   target type

.. code-block-meta:
   skip

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a: number = expr // target type of 'expr' is number

    function foo(s: string) {}
    foo(expr) // target type of 'expr' is string

In some cases, the type of an expression cannot be inferred (see
:ref:`Type Inference`) from the expression itself (see
:ref:`Object Literal` as an example). If such an expression is used as a
*standalone expression*, then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class P { x: number, y: number }

    let x = { x: 10, y: 10 } // standalone object literal - compile time error
    let y: P = { x: 10, y: 10 } // OK, type of object literal is inferred

The evaluation of an expression type requires completing the following steps:

#. Collect information for type inference (type annotation,
   generic constraints, etc);

#. Perform :ref:`Type Inference`;

#. If the expression type is not yet inferred at a previous step, and the
   expression is a literal in the general sense, including :ref:`Array Literal`,
   then an attempt is made to evaluate the type from the expression itself.

.. index::
   expression
   standalone expression
   expression type
   context
   evaluation
   array literal
   inferred type
   string
   type annotation
   generic
   constraint
   type inference
   object
   literal

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if none of these steps produces an
appropriate expression type.

If the expression  type is ``readonly``, then the target type must
also be ``readonly``. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      let readonly_array: readonly number[] = [1, 2, 3]

      foo1(readonly_array) // OK
      foo2(readonly_array) // compile-time error

      function foo1 (p: readonly number[]) {}
      function foo2 (p: number[]) {}

      let writable_array: number [] = [1, 2, 3]
      foo1 (writable_array) // OK, as always safe

.. index::

   expression type

.. _Normal and Abrupt Completion of Expression Evaluation:

Normal and Abrupt Completion of Expression Evaluation
=====================================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Each expression in a normal mode of evaluation requires certain computational
steps. Normal modes of evaluation for each kind of expression are described
in the following sections.

An expression evaluation *completes normally* if all computational steps
are performed without throwing an error.

On the contrary, an expression evaluation *completes abruptly* if an error is
thrown in the process. The information on the cause of an abrupt completion
is provided in the value attached to the error object.

.. index::
   normal completion
   abrupt completion
   evaluation
   expression
   error
   error object
   value

Runtime errors can occur as a result of expression or operator evaluation as
follows:

-  If the value of an array index expression is negative, or greater than, or
   equal to the length of the array, then an *array indexing expression* (see
   :ref:`Array Indexing Expression`) throws ``RangeError``.
-  If the type of a value being assigned to a fixed-size array element is not
   a subtype of an array element type, then an :ref:`Assignment` throws
   *ArrayStoreError*.
-  If a :ref:`Cast Expression` conversion cannot be performed at runtime, then
   it throws ``ClassCastError``.
-  If a right-hand expression has the zero value, then the integer division or
   integer remainder (see :ref:`Division` and :ref:`Remainder`) operator throws
   ``ArithmeticError``.

.. index::
   predefined operator
   evaluation
   expression
   operator evaluation
   expression evaluation
   operator
   runtime error
   array reference expression
   value
   array access expression
   error
   array indexing expression
   array
   fixed-size array
   subtype
   array length
   runtime
   cast expression
   integer division
   integer remainder
   operator
   remainder operator
   array element
   array element type
   assignment

An error during the evaluation of an expression can be caused by a possible
hard-to-predict and hard-to-handle linkage and virtual machine error.

Abrupt completion of the evaluation of a subexpression results in the following:

-  Immediate abrupt completion of an expression that contains the subexpression
   (if the evaluation of the contained subexpression is required
   for the evaluation of the entire expression); and
-  Cancellation of all subsequent steps of the normal mode of evaluation.

The terms *complete normally* and *complete abruptly* can also denote
normal and abrupt completion of the execution of a statement (see
:ref:`Normal and Abrupt Statement Execution`). A statement can complete
abruptly for many reasons in addition to an error being thrown.

.. index::
   normal completion

.. _Order of Expression Evaluation:

Order of Expression Evaluation
==============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The operands of an operator are evaluated from left to right in accordance with
the following rules:

-  The order of evaluation depends on the assignment operator (see
   :ref:`Assignment`).

-  Any right-hand expression is evaluated only after the left-hand expression
   of a binary operator is fully evaluated.

-  Any part of the operation can be executed only after every operand of an
   operator (except conditional operators ``'&&'``, ``'||'``, and ``'?:'``)
   is fully evaluated.

   The execution of a binary operator that is an integer division ``'/'`` (see
   :ref:`Division`), or integer remainder ``'%'`` (see :ref:`Remainder`) can
   throw ``ArithmeticError`` only after the evaluations of both operands
   complete normally.

-  The |LANG| programming language follows the order of evaluation as indicated
   explicitly by parentheses, and implicitly by the precedence of operators.
   This rule particularly applies for infinity and ``NaN`` values of
   floating-point calculations.
   |LANG| considers integer addition and multiplication as provably associative.
   However, floating-point calculations must not be naively reordered because
   they are unlikely to be computationally associative (even though they appear
   mathematically associative).

.. _Evaluation of Arguments:

Evaluation of Arguments
=======================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

An evaluation of arguments always progresses from left to right up to the first
error, or through the end of the expression; i.e., any argument expression is
evaluated after the evaluation of each argument expression to its left
completes normally (including comma-separated argument expressions that appear
within parentheses in method calls, constructor calls, class instance creation
expressions, or function call expressions).

If the left-hand argument expression completes abruptly, then no part of the
right-hand argument expression is evaluated.

.. index::
   evaluation

   error
   expression

   comma-separated argument expression

.. _Evaluation of Other Expressions:

Evaluation of Other Expressions
===============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

These general rules cannot cover the order of evaluation of certain expressions
when they from time to time cause exceptional conditions. The order of
evaluation of the following expressions requires specific explanation:

-  Class instance creation expressions (see :ref:`New Expressions`);
-  :ref:`Resizable Array Creation Expressions`;
-  :ref:`Indexing Expressions`;
-  Method call expressions (see :ref:`Method Call Expression`);
-  Assignments involving indexing (see :ref:`Assignment`);
-  :ref:`Lambda Expressions`.

.. _Named Reference:

Named Reference
***************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

An expression can have the form of a *named reference* as described by the
syntax rule as follows:

.. code-block:: abnf

    namedReference:
      qualifiedName typeArguments?
      ;

Type of a *named reference* expression is the type of the entity to which a
*named reference* refers.

*QualifiedName* (see :ref:`Names`) is an expression that consists of
dot-separated names. If *qualifiedName* consists of a single identifier, then
it is called a *simple name*.

.. index::
   expression
   named reference
   qualified name
   syntax
   entity
   dot-separated name
   simple name

*Simple name* refers to the following:

-  Entity declared in the current module, i.e.,

   - Variable name,
   - Constant name,
   - Function name,
   - Accessor name.


-  Local variable or parameter of the surrounding function or method.

If not a *simple name*, *qualifiedName* refers to the following:

-  Entity imported from a module,
-  Entity exported from a namespace,
-  Member of some class or interface, or
-  Special syntax form of :ref:`Record Indexing Expression`.

If *typeArguments* are provided, then *qualifiedName* is a valid instantiation
of the generic method or function. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error`
occurs.

A :index:`compile-time error` also occurs if a name referred by *qualifiedName*
is one of the following:

-  Undefined or inaccessible;
-  Named constructor (see :ref:`Named Constructors`).

Type of a *named reference* is the type of an expression.

If a *named reference* refers to a function name, it is called :ref:`Function Reference`.
If a *named reference* refers to a method name, it is called :ref:`Method Reference`.

.. index::

   named constructor
   named reference
   name
   function reference
   method reference

|

.. _Function Reference:

Function Reference
==================

A *function reference* refers to a declared or imported function.
Type of a *function reference* is derived from the function signature:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   function foo(n: number): string { return n.toString() }
   let func = foo // type of func is '(n: number) => string'
   let x = func(1)  // foo() called via reference

A *function reference* can refer to a generic function but only
if :ref:`Explicit Generic Instantiations` is present, otherwise
a :index:`compile-time error` occurs:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function gen<T> (x: T) {}

    let a = gen<string> // ok
    let b = gen // compile-time error: no explicit type arguments

.. index::
   function reference
   function signature
   declared function
   imported function
   generic function
   generic instantiation
   type argument

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the name of an *overloaded function*
(see :ref:`Implicit Function Overloading`) or the name of an *explicit overload*
(see :ref:`Explicit Function Overload`) is used as a function reference:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function bar(n: number) {}
    function bar(s: string) {}

    let b = bar // Compile-time error: overloaded function name

    function foo1(n: number) {}
    function foo2(s: string) {}
    overload foo { foo1, foo2 }

    foo(1)          // OK, overload call
    let x = foo     // Compile-time error: explicit overload name
    let y = foo2    // ok, ref to foo2

|

.. _Method Reference:

Method Reference
================

A *method reference* refers to a *static* or *instance* method
of a class or an interface.
Type of a *method reference* is derived from the method signature:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
      static foo(n: number) {}
      bar (s: string): boolean { return true }
    }

    // Method reference to a static method
    const m1 = C.foo  // type of 'm1' is (n: number) => void

    // Method reference to an instance method
    const m2 = new C().bar // type of 'm1' is (s: string) => boolean

.. index::
   method reference
   static method
   instance method
   class
   interface
   method signature

If *method reference* refers to an instance method, that the named reference
is bounded with the used instance of that class or interface.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        field = 123
        method(): number { return this.field }
    }
    let c1 = new C
    let c2 = new C
    let m1 = c1.method // 'c1' is bounded
    let m2 = c2.method // 'c2' is bounded
    c1.field = 42
    console.log (m1(), m2()) // Outputs: 42 123

A *method reference* can refer to a generic method only if a generic
instantiation is explicitly present (see :ref:`Explicit Generic Instantiations`).
Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs:

.. index::
   method reference
   instance method
   named reference
   class
   interface
   generic method
   generic instantiation
   method signature

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        gen<T> (x: T) {}
    }

    let a = new C().gen<string> // ok
    let b = new C().gen // compile-time error: no explicit type arguments

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the name of an *overloaded method*
(see :ref:`Implicit Method Overloading`, :ref:`Explicit Class Method Overload`,
and :ref:`Explicit Class Method Overload`) is used as a method reference:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
        foo1(n: number) {}
        foo2(s: string) {}
        overload foo { foo1, foo2 }

        function bar(n: number) {}
        function bar(s: string) {}
    }

    let c = new C()
    let f = c.foo // compile-time error
    let b = c.bar // compile-time error

    todo: let x = ([1,2,3][1]) - should be CTE, but it isn't
    todo: implement it properly for invocation context to get type from the context, not from the first element

*Array literal* is an expression that can be used to create an array or tuple
in some cases, with all element values explicitly defined.

The syntax of *array literal* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    arrayLiteral:
        '[' expressionSequence? ']'
        ;

    expressionSequence:
        expression (',' expression)* ','?
        ;

An *array literal* is a comma-separated list of *initializer expressions*
enclosed in square brackets ``'['`` and ``']'``. A trailing comma after the last
expression in an array literal is ignored:

.. index::
   array literal
   array
   tuple
   expression
   class
   value
   syntax
   initializer expression
   trailing comma
   bracket

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let x = [1, 2, 3] // ok
    let y = [1, 2, 3,] // ok, trailing comma is ignored

The number of initializer expressions enclosed in square brackets of the array
initializer determines the length of the array to be constructed.

If memory is allocated as required for an array literal, then an array of the
specified length is created, and all elements of the array are initialized to
the values specified by initializer expressions.

.. index::
   initializer expression
   brace
   array length
   array initializer
   array
   array element
   initialization
   initializer expression
   value

On the contrary, the evaluation of an *array literal* expression completes
abruptly if:

-  Not enough memory is available for a new array, and ``OutOfMemoryError`` is
   thrown; or
-  Some initialization expression completes abruptly.

.. index::
   evaluation
   abrupt completion

Initializer expressions are executed from left to right. The *n*’th expression
specifies the value of the *n-1*’th element of the array.

Array literals can be nested (i.e., the initializer expression that specifies
an array element can be an array literal if that element is of array type).

Type of an *array literal expression* is inferred by the following rules:

.. index::
   initializer expression
   execution
   value
   nested literal
   array element
   array literal expression
   array literal
   array type
   type inference

-  If a context is available, then type is inferred from the context. If
   successful, then type of an array literal is the inferred type. Otherwise,
   a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.    
-  If no context is available, then type is inferred from the types of array
   literal elements (see :ref:`Array Type Inference from Types of Elements`). 

More details of both cases are presented below.

.. _Array Literal Type Inference from Context:

Array Literal Type Inference from Context
=========================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Type of an array literal can be inferred from the *context* that can be
specified as one of the following:

- Explicit type annotation of a variable declaration;
- Left-hand part type of an assignment;
- Explicit return type of a function, a method, or a lambda in a return statement;
- Parameter type in a call;
- Target type of a cast expression; or
- Type of an array element or a class field.

Possible variants are represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a: number[] = [1, 2, 3] // ok, variable type in a declaration is used
    a = [4, 5] // ok, variable type is used

    let b = [1, 2, 3] as number[]    // ok, cast target type is used

    function min(x: number[]): number {
      let m = x[0]
      for (let v of x) {
        if (v < m) m = v
      }
      return m
    }
    min([1., 3.14, 0.99]); // ok, parameter type is used

    // Array of array initialization
    type Matrix = number[][]
    let m: Matrix = [
        [1, 2], [3, 4] // ok, element type is used
    ]

    class aClass {}
    //
    let b1: Array <aClass> = [new aClass, new aClass]
    let b2: Array <number> = [1, 2, 3]
    let b3: FixedArray<number> = [1, 2]
      /* Type of literal is inferred from the context
         taken from b1, b2 and b3 declarations */

.. index::
   type
   inferred type
   type inference
   variable
   variable declaration
   assignment
   cast expression
   call parameter type
   array initialization
   array literal

   array

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the type specified by context
is **not** one of the following:

- ``Any``;
- ``Object``;
- Tuple type;
- Fixed-size array type;
- Resizable array type;
- Superinterface of a resizable array type;
- Union type that contains at least one consitituent type from the above list.

If type used in a context is ``Any`` or ``Object``, then
:ref:`Array Type Inference from Types of Elements` is used: 

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a: Object = [1, 2, 3] // ok, array literal is of int[] type

If type used in a context is a *tuple type* (see :ref:`Tuple Types`),
then it is inferred as an array literal type on the following conditions:

- Number of expressions equals the number of constituent types;
- Type of each expression in the array literal is assignable (see
  :ref:`Assignability`) to the constituent type at the respective position. 

Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let tuple: [number, string] = [1, "hello"] // ok
    let incorrect: [number, string] = ["hello", 1] // compile-time error

If type used in a context is a *fixed-size array type* (see
:ref:`Fixed-size Array Types`), and type of each expression is
assignable to an array element type, then an array literal is of
the specified type. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs. 

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a: FixedArray<string> = ["hello", "world"] // ok
    let b: FixedArray<string> = [1, 2]             // compile-time error
    let c: FixedArray<Object> = [1, "hello"]       // ok

If type used in a context is a *resizeble array type* (see
:ref:`Resizable Array Types` and including :ref:`Readonly Array Types`),
and type of each expression is assignable to an array element type,
then an array literal is of the specified type.
Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a: Array<string> = ["aa", "bb"]     // ok
    let b: string[] = ["aa", "bb"]          // ok
    let c: readonly string[] = ["aa", "bb"] // ok

    let d: string[] = ["aa", 2]             // compile-time error

    let o: Object[] = ["aa", 2]             // ok

If type used in a context is an interface ``I``, and:

- If ``I`` is a generic superinterface of a resizable array type with
  the single type parameter ``I<T>``, then an array literal is considered
  as an instance of ``Array<T>``. If each expression is assignable
  to ``T``, then the array literal is of ``I<T>``. Otherwise, a
  :index:`compile-time error` occurs;

- If ``I`` is a non-generic superinterface of a resizable array type,
  then an array literal type is evaluated by using
  :ref:`Array Type Inference from Types of Elements`, and
  then inferred as ``I``;

- Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

This situation is represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface SomeI {}
    let a = [1, 2] as SomeI // compile-time error: SomeI is not a superinterface of Array

    let b: ConcatArray<number> = [1, 2]  // ok, instance of Array<number>
    let c: ConcatArray<string> = [1, 2]  // compile-time error: int is not assignable to string
    let d: ArrayLike<Object> = [1, "aa"] // ok, instance of Array<Object>

If a type used in a context is a *union type* (see :ref:`Union Types`),
then the step :ref:`Array Literal Type Inference from Context` is taken
repetitively trying to use each type of the *union type* as the context.
If only a single type is inferred, then this single type is used as the
type of the literal. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let union_1: string[] | [int, int] = [1, 2]
   // OK, literal type is a tuple [int, int]

   let union_2: number[] | [number, number] = [1, 2]
   // Error, as both union types accept literal [1, 2] as valid values

   let union_3: (number | string )[] | [(number | string), number] = ["xxx", 2]
   // Error, as both union types accept literal ["xxx", 2] as valid values

   let union_4: (number | string )[] | [(number | string), number] | string = "xxx"
   // OK, as only type string matches the type of "xxx" literal

   let union_5: (number | string )[] | [(number | string), number, boolean] | string = [5, 5]
   // OK, literal type is a array (number | string )[]

.. _Array Type Inference from Types of Elements:

Array Type Inference from Types of Elements
===========================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Where no context is set, and thus the type of an array literal cannot be
inferred from the context (see :ref:`Type of Expression`), the type of array
literal ``[`` ``expr``:sub:`1`, ``...`` , ``expr``:sub:`N` ``]`` is inferred
from the initialization expression instead by using the following algorithm:


.. #. If there is no expression (*N == 0*), then type is ``Object[]``.

#. If array literal (*N == 0*) includes no element, then the type of
   the array literal cannot be inferred, and a :index:`compile-time error`
   occurs.

#. If at least one element of an expression type cannot be determined, then
   the type of the array literal cannot be inferred, and a
   :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

#. If all initialization expressions are of the same type ``T``,
   then the array literal type is ``T[]``.

#. If each initialization expression is of a numeric type (see
   :ref:`Numeric Types`), then the array literal type is ``number[]``.

#. Otherwise, the array literal type is constructed as the union type
   ``T``:sub:1 ``| ... | T``:sub:`N`,
   where ``T``:sub:`i` is the type of *expr*:sub:`i`, and then:

    - If ``T``:sub:`i` is a literal type, then it is replaced for its supertype;

    - If ``T``:sub:`i` is a union type comprised of literal types, then each
      constituent literal type is replaced for its supertype.

    - :ref:`Union Types Normalization` is applied to the resultant union type
      after the above replacements.

.. _Object Literal:

Object Literal
***************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Object literal* is an expression that can be used to create a class instance
with methods and fields with initial values. In some cases it is more
convenient to use an *object literal* in place of a class instance creation
expression (see :ref:`New Expressions`).

.. index::
   object literal
   expression
   instance
   class
   class instance
   instance creation expression

The syntax of *object literal* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    objectLiteral:
       '{' objectLiteralMembers? '}'
       ;

    objectLiteralMembers:
       objectLiteralMember (',' objectLiteralMember)* ','?
       ;

    objectLiteralMember:
       objectLiteralField | objectLiteralMethod
       ;

    objectLiteralField:
       identifier ':' expression
       ;

    objectLiteralMethod:
       identifier typeParameters? signature block
       ;


An *object literal* is written as a comma-separated list of
*object literal members* enclosed in curly braces ``'{'`` and ``'}'``. A
trailing comma after the last member is ignored. Each *object literal member*
can be either an *object literal field* or an *object literal method*.

More details are here :ref:`Object Literal of Class Type` and
:ref:`Object Literal of Interface Type`:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

      class A {}
      interface I {
         m(): void
      }
      abstract class B {
         m(): void
      }
      const a: A = { m(): void {} } // compile-time error: no m() in class A
      const i: I = { m(): void {} } // OK
      const b: B = { m(): void {} } // OK

.. index::
   object literal
   method

An *object literal field* consists of an identifier and an expression as follows:

.. index::
   object literal
   comma-separated list
   name-value pair
   curly brace
   trailing comma
   identifier
   expression

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Person {
      name: string = ""
      age: number = 0
    }
    let b: Person = {name: "Bob", age: 25}
    let a: Person = {name: "Alice", age: 18, } //ok, trailing comma is ignored
    let c: Person | number = {name: "Mary", age: 17} // literal will be of type Person

An *object literal method* is a complete declaration of a public method.
Examples of object literals with methods are provided in
:ref:`Object Literal of Interface Type`.


Type of an *object literal expression* is always some class ``C`` that is
inferred from the context. A type inferred from the context can be either a
class (see :ref:`Object Literal of Class Type`), or an anonymous class created
for the inferred interface type (see :ref:`Object Literal of Interface Type`).

.. index::
   object literal
   object literal expression

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

-  Type of an *object literal* cannot be inferred from the context (see
   :ref:`Type of Expression` for an example);
-  Inferred type is not a class or interface type;
-  Context is a union type, and an object literal can be treated
   as a valid value of several union component types;
-  New member in an *object literal* is declared;

    class B { field = 2 }

    let q: A | B = {field: 6}
            // compile-time error, type cannot be inferred as the literal
            // fits both A and B

    let u: A = { field: 1, otherField: 2 }
            // compile-time error, cannot declare a new member in the literal

If class type ``C`` is inferred from the context, then type of an object
literal is ``C``:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Person {

    function foo(p: Person) { /*some code*/ }
    // ...
    let p: Person = {name: "Bob", age: 25} /* ok, variable type is
         used */
    foo({name: "Alice", age: 18}) // ok, parameter type is used

An identifier in each *object literal field* must name a field of class ``C``.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the identifier does not name an
*accessible member field* (see :ref:`Accessible`) in type ``C``:

.. index::
   identifier
   field
   class
   compile-time error

      private nick: string = ""
      age: number
      sex?: "male"|"female"
    }
    // compile-time error, nick is private:
    let f: Friend = {name: "Alexander", age: 55, nick: "Alex"}
    // compile-time error, soname is protected:
    let g: Friend = {name: "Alexander", age: 55, soname: "Reed"}

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if type of an expression in an
*object literal field* is not assignable (see :ref:`Assignability`) to the
field type:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let f: Friend = {name: 123} /* compile-time error - type of right hand-side
    is not assignable to the type of the left hand-side */

Only class fields that have default values (see :ref:`Default Values for Types`)
or explicit initializers (see :ref:`Variable and Constant Declarations`) can be
skipped in an object literal. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time` error occurs.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let f: Friend = {} /* OK, as name, nick, age, and sex have either default
                          value or explicit initializer */

    class C {
        f1: number
        f2: string
        f3!: Object
    }
    let c1: C = {f2: "xyz", f3: new Object} // OK, f1 type has a default value
    let c2: C = {f2: "xyz"} // compile-time error, f3 value is not provided

.. index::

If type of an object literal is class ``C``, then class ``C`` must have an
explicit or default *parameterless* constructor, or a constructor with all
parameters of the second form of optional parameters (see
:ref:`Optional Parameters`) that is *accessible* (see :ref:`Accessible`) in the
class-composite context. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

These situations are presented in the examples below:

.. index::
   parameterless constructor
   class
   accessibility
   context
   class-composite context
   object literal

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {

    }
    // ...
    let c: C = {} /* compile-time error - no parameterless
           constructor */

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
      private constructor () {}
    }
    // ...
    let c: C = {} /* compile-time error - constructor is not
        accessible */

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
      constructor (p?: number) {}
    }
    // ...
    let c: C = {} // OK as constructor of has an optional parameter

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {
    }
    // ...
    let c: C = {} // OK as default constructor is added


A compile-time error occurs if an *object literal of class type* explicitly sets
readonly fields of a class:

.. code-block:: typescript

    class C {
        field1 = 123
        readonly field2: number
        readonly field3: string
        constructor () {
            this.field3 = ""
        }
    }

    // OK - type ``number`` has default value, field3 set in ctor
    let c: C = { field1: 654 }

    // Error: field2 and field3 are readonly, cannot be set explicitly
    let d: C = { field1: 654, field2: 3, field3: "text" }


If a class has accessors (see :ref:`Class Accessor Declarations`) for a property,
and its setter is provided, then this property can be used as a part of an
object literal. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class OK {
        set attr (attr: number) {}
    }
    const a: OK = {attr: 42} // OK, as the setter be called

    class Err {
        get attr (): number { return 42 }
    }
    const b: Err = {attr: 42} // compile-time error - no setter for 'attr'

.. index::
   accessor

If a class is an abstract one it can be also used with *object literals*:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    abstract class A {
        foo () : void
    }
    const a1: A = { foo() {} } // OK, foo() is properly defined
    const a2: A = {} // compile-time error as foo() implementation is not defined

*Object literal* may provide a method with override-compatible (see
:ref:`Override-Compatible Signatures`) signature:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Base {}
    class Drv1 extends Base {}
    class Drv2 extends Base {}

    class A {
        foo (p: Drv1) {}
        foo (p: Drv2) {}
    }
    const a1: A = { foo(p: Base) {} } // OK, foo(p: Base) overrides both foo (p: Drv1) and foo (p: Drv2)
    const a2: A = { foo (p: number) {} } // compile-time error as foo(p: number) is a new method declaration
    const a3: A = { foo(p: Drv2) {} } // OK, foo(p: Drv2) overrides only foo (p: Drv2) but not foo (p: Drv1)

.. _Object Literal of Interface Type:

Object Literal of Interface Type
================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

If an interface type ``I`` is inferred from the context, then type of an
object literal is an anonymous class implicitly created for interface ``I``:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface Person {
      name: string
      set surname(s: string)
      get age(): number
    }
    let b: Person = {name: "Bob", surname: "Doe", age: 25}

In the example above, type of ``b`` is an anonymous class that contains the
same fields as properties of interface ``I``. An anonymous class created
for the example above has the following fields:

    - ``name: string``
    - ``surname: string``
    - ``age: number``

If a property is defined as a getter, then the type of a field is the
return type of the getter. If a property is defined as a setter,
then the type of a field is the type of the parameter.
If a property is defined as both a getter and a setter, then the parameter type
of the setter and the return type of the getter must be the same. Otherwise, a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs as described in
:ref:`Implementing Required Interface Properties`.

.. index::
   interface type
   type inference
   inferred type
   context
   object literal
   anonymous class
   interface
   field

Any properties that are optional can be skipped in an object literal.
The values of such optional properties are set to ``undefined`` as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface Person {
      name: string
      age: number
      sex?: "male"|"female"
    }
    let b: Person = {name: "Bob", age: 25}
         // 'sex' field will have 'undefined' value

Properties that are non-optional cannot be skipped in an object literal,
despite some property types having default values (see
:ref:`Default Values for Types`). If a non-optional property (e.g., *age* in
the example above) is skipped, then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

An object literal of interface type must provide an implementation for all
interface methods with no default implementation. All such methods are
public as in the interface.


.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I {
      print_name (name: string): void
      print_something() { console.log ("Something") }
    }
    let i: I = {
      print_name (name: string) { console.log(name) }
      // No need to implement print_something()
    }
    i.print_name ("Alice")
    i.print_something()


Any reference to ``this`` in an object literal method is a reference to
an anonymous class (which is a subtype of the interface) created for the
inferred interface type:

*Object literal* can provide a method with an override-compatible signature
(see :ref:`Override-Compatible Signatures`):


.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Base {}
    class Drv1 extends Base {}
    class Drv2 extends Base {}

    interface A {
        foo (p: Drv1): Base
        foo (p: Drv2): Base
    }
    const a1: A = { foo(p: Base): Drv1 {} }

    const a2: A = { // OK
       foo(p: Drv1): Drv1 { return new Drv1 } // implements foo (p: Drv1): Base
       foo(p: Drv2): Drv2 { return new Drv2 } // implements foo (p: Drv2): Base
    }

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if an object literal of interface type
introduces a new method:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I {}
    const i: I = { foo(): void {} } // compile-time error

If an interface has a method implementation, then its object literal can
optionally  provide a new method implementation. Otherwise, the interface
implementation is used:

   object literal
   interface
   method
   method implementation


.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   interface I {
      method(): void { console.log ("method() from I is called") }
   }

   // Valid literal of anonymous class type using interface method
   const i1: I = {}
   i1.method()

   // Valid literal of anonymous class type using own method declaration

An interface property is set within an object literal by a value. It is
independent of the form it is defined in (see :ref:`Interface Properties`).
The definition within the interface determines how the the property is used:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I1 {
        set attr (attr: number)
    }
    const i1: I1 = {attr: 42} // OK - 'attr' is writable property
    console.log (i1.attr) // compile-time error as attr has no getter

    interface I2 {

.. _Object Literal of Record Type:

Object Literal of ``Record`` Type
=================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Generic type ``Record<Key, Value>`` (see :ref:`Record Utility Type`) is used
to map properties of a type (type ``Key``) to another type (type ``Value``).
A special form of object literal is used to initialize the value of such
type:

.. index::
   object literal
   generic type
   utility type
   record type
   type property
   value type
   key type
   initialization
   value

The syntax of *record literal* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    recordLiteral:
       '{' keyValueSequence? '}'
       ;

    keyValueSequence:
       keyValue (',' keyValue)* ','?
       ;

    keyValue:
       expression ':' expression
       ;

The first expression in ``keyValue`` denotes a key and must be of type ``Key``.
The second expression denotes a value and must be of type ``Value``:

.. index::
   expression
   key
   value

.. code-block:: typescript

    let map: Record<string, number> = {
        "John": 25,
        "Mary": 21,
    }

    console.log(map["John"]) // prints 25

.. code-block:: typescript

    interface PersonInfo {
        age: number
        salary: number
    }
    let map: Record<string, PersonInfo> = {
        "John": { age: 25, salary: 10},
        "Mary": { age: 21, salary: 20}
    }

If a key is a union of literal types, then all variants
must be listed in the object literal. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error`
occurs:

.. index::
   syntax
   key type
   value
   union type
   literal
   object literal

.. code-block:: typescript

    let map: Record<"aa" | "bb", number> = {
        "aa": 1,
    } // compile-time error: "bb" key is missing

.. _Object Literal Evaluation:

Object Literal Evaluation
=========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The evaluation of an object literal of type ``C`` (where ``C`` is either
a named class type or an anonymous class type created for the interface)
is to be performed by the following steps:

-  Call to class ``C`` constructor with no arguments is executed to initialize
   an instance ``x`` of class ``C``. The evaluation of the object literal
   completes abruptly if so does the execution of the constructor.

-  All *object literal fields* are then processed from left to right in the
   textual order they occur in the source code. The following steps are
   performed for every *object literal field*:

   -  Evaluation of the expression; and
   -  If successful, then an assignment of the expression value to the
      corresponding field of ``x`` as its initial value. Otherwise, the
      evaluation of the object literal completes abruptly.


.. index::

The execution of an object literal completes abruptly if so does
the execution of at least one of *object literal field* expression.

The evaluation of an object literal completes normally if:

- Class instance was created successfully;
- Class constructor was executed successfully;
- All class instance fields mentioned in the object literal have initial
  values resulting from the successful execution of all *object literal field*
  expressions.

.. _Spread Expression:

Spread Expression
*****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Spread expression* can be used only within an array literal (see
:ref:`Array Literal`) or argument passing (see :ref:`Rest Parameter`).
The *expression* must be of an iterable type (see :ref:`Iterable Types`)
or a tuple type (see :ref:`Tuple Types`). 

Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

The syntax of *spread expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    spreadExpression:
        '...' expression
        ;

A *spread expression* is evaluated:

-  At compile time by the compiler if *expression* is constant (see
   :ref:`Constant Expressions`);
-  Otherwise, at runtime.

Any iterable or tuple object referred by the *expression* is broken down
into a sequence of values by the evaluation. This sequence is used where
a *spread expression* is used. It can be an assignment, a call of a function,
method, or constructor. A sequence of types of these values is the type of the
*spread expression*.

.. index::
   spread expression
   array literal
   argument
   expression
   array type
   tuple type
   iterator
   iterable type
   syntax
   runtime
   compiler
   evaluation
   constant
   value
   call
   function
   method
   constructor
   assignment

*Spread expression* is one of the two |LANG| concepts that use the ``spread``
operator ``'...'`` as a prefix. The difference between *spread expressions* and
syntactically similar *rest parameters* is as follows:

- *Spread expression* **generates** a sequence of values. E.g., a sequence can
  be generated from a type with an iterator.
- *Rest parameter* **receives** a sequence of values and stores the values in
  an array or a tuple. A *rest parameter* knows nothing about the origin of the
  values, i.e., the sequence can be a product of a spread operator, or the
  values can be a result of a direct input.

It is represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   function f(...a: number[]) {} // Rest, put caller values into an array

   f(1,2)    // Thanks to Rest, we can put some values directly ...
   let arglist: number[] = [1, 2, 3]
   f(...arglist)  // or  say that all values from 'arglist' must be substituted


*Spread expression* of array type supports both :ref:`Resizable array types`
and :ref:`Fixed-size array types`. Any combination of *spread expressions*
with fixed-size and resizable arrays can be used in an array literal or in
a function call as illustrated in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let array1: int[] = [1, 2, 3]
   let array2: FixedArray<int> = [4, 5]

   // A literal contains two spread expressions with arrays of variable and fixed size
   let array3: int[] = [...array1, ...array2] // spread array1 and array2 elements
                                        // while building new array literal at compile time
   console.log(array3) // prints [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

   function foo (...array: int[]) {
      console.log (array)
   }

   // The next two calls are equivalent
   foo(...array2)
   foo (...[...array2])  // spread array2 elements into arguments of the foo() call

   // recall,  'array3 = [ ..array1, ..array2])' (see above)
   // next two calls are also equivalent
   foo(...array3)
   foo(...[...array1, ...array2])

   function run_time_spread_application1 (a1: int[], a2: FixedArray<int>) {
      console.log ([...a1, 42, ...a2])
      // array literal will be built at runtime
   }
   run_time_spread_application1 (array1, array2) // prints [1, 2, 3, 42, 4, 5]


*Spread expression* always copies values from original arrays. A callee
changes elements of its own copy, but not elements of arrays used in the call:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let a: int[] = [1, 2, 3]

   function foo (...p: int[]) {
      p[1] = 4
      console.log ("inside foo()", p)
   }
   foo(...a)  // prints 'inside foo() 1,4,3'
   console.log ("outside foo()", a) // prints 'outside foo() 1,2,3'


Since a *spread expression* copies values, the attribute ``readonly`` of the
source array (see :ref:`Readonly Array Types`) does not affect an array created
by the *spread expression*. If a *spread expression* is to create a readonly
target array, then the attribute ``readonly`` must be used for the target array
or for the *rest parameter*:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let a: readonly int[] = [1, 2, 3]
   let b: int[] = [1, 2, 3]

   // 'readonly' array in spread expr, can modify target array Elements
   let rw: int[] = [...a]
   rw[1] = 1 // ok
   function foo(...p_rw: int[]) {
      p_rw[1] = 1 // OK
   }

   // RW array in spread, readonly target
   let ro: readonly int[] = [...b]
      ro[1] = 1 // compile-time error
   function foo(...p_ro: readonly int[]) {
      p_ro[1] = 1 // compile-time error
   }


A spread expression for tuples is represented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:


    let tuple1: [number, string, boolean] = [1, "2", true]
    let tuple2: [number, string] = [4, "5"]
     // spread tuple1 and tuple2 elements
    let tuple3: [number, string, boolean, number, string] = [...tuple1, ...tuple2]
       // while building new tuple object at compile time
    console.log(tuple3) // prints [1, 2, true, 4, 5]

    function bar (...tuple: [number, string]) {
      console.log (tuple)
    }
    bar (...tuple2)  // spread tuple2 elements into arguments of the foo() call

    function run_time_spread_application2 (a1: [number, string, boolean], a2: [number, string]) {
      console.log ([...a1, 42, ...a2])
        // such array literal will be built at runtime
    }
    run_time_spread_application2 (tuple1, tuple2) // prints [1, 2, true, 42, 4, "5"]


A spread expression for a class that implements Iterable is represented in
the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:


    class A<T> implements Iterable<T|undefined> { // variables of type A can be spread
        // To check code with TS, comment line with  `$_iterator()`
        // and uncomment one with `[Symbol.iterator]()`
        $_iterator(): Iterator<T|undefined>  {
        // [Symbol.iterator](): Iterator<T|undefined>  {
          return new MyIteratorResult<T|undefined>(this.data)
        }
        private data: T[]
        constructor (...data: T[]) { this.data = data }
    }
    class MyIteratorResult <T> implements Iterator<T|undefined> {
        private data: T[]
        private index: number = 0
        next(): IteratorResult<T|undefined> {
            if (this.index >= this.data.length) {
               return MyIteratorResult.end_of_sequence
            } else {
               this.current_element.value = this.data[this.index++]
               return this.current_element
            }
        }
        constructor (data: T[]) { this.data = data }
        private static end_of_sequence: IteratorResult<undefined> = {done: true, value: undefined}
        private current_element: IteratorResult<T|undefined> = {done: false, value: undefined}
    }
    function display<T> (...p: T[]) { console.log (p) }
    display (... new A<number> (1, 2, 3))        // Spread A with numbers
    display (... new A<string> ("aaa", "bbb"))   // Spread A with strings
    display (... new A<Object> (1, "aaa", true)) // Spread A with any objects
    display (... new A<undefined>)               // Spread A with no objects

    type UnionOfIterable = A<number> | new A<string>
    function show (...p: UnionOfIterable) { console.log (p) }
    show (... new A<number> (1, 2, 3))        // Spread A with numbers
    show (... new A<string> ("aaa", "bbb"))   // Spread A with strings


.. note::
   If an argument is spread at the call site, then an appropriate parameter
   must be of the rest kind (see :ref:`Rest Parameter`). A
   :index:`compile-time error` occurs if an argument is spread into a sequence
   of ordinary non-optional parameters as follows:

   .. code-block:: typescript
      :linenos:

       function foo1 (n1: number, n2: number) // non-rest parameters
          { ... }
       let an_array = [1, 2]
       foo1 (...an_array) // compile-time error

       function foo2 (n1: number, n2: string)  // non-rest parameters

    frontend_status: Done


The syntax of *this expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    thisExpression:
        'this'
        ;

The keyword ``this`` can be used as an expression in the body of an instance
method of a class (see :ref:`Method Body`) or an interface (see
:ref:`Default Interface Method Declarations`). A corresponding class or
interface type is the type of *this* expression. If a method is declared in an
object literal (see :ref:`Object Literal`), then the type of the object literal
is the type of ``this``.

The keyword ``this`` can be used in a lambda expression only if it is allowed
in the context in which the lambda expression occurs. The type of ``this`` is
the type of a class or an interface in which it is declared, but not the type
of the surrounding object literal type, if any.

The keyword ``this`` in a *direct call* expression ``this(`` *arguments* ``)``
can only be used in an explicit constructor call statement (see
:ref:`Explicit Constructor Call`).

The keyword ``this`` can also be used in the body of a function with receiver
(see :ref:`Functions with Receiver`). The type of *this* expression is the
declared type of the parameter ``this`` in a function.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the keyword ``this`` appears elsewhere.

.. index::
   syntax
   this keyword
   expression
   instance method
   method body
   class
   interface

   object literal
   direct call expression
   constructor
   context
   constructor call statement
   function with receiver
   parameter
   function
   declared type

The keyword ``this`` used as a primary expression denotes a value that is a
reference to the following:

-  Object for which the instance method is called; or
-  Object being constructed.

The parameter ``this`` in a lambda body and in the surrounding context denote
the same value.

The class of the actual object referred to at runtime can be ``T`` if ``T`` is
a class type, or a subclass of ``T`` (see :ref:`Subtyping`) .

    interface anInterface {
        method() {
           this // type of 'this' is anInterface
        }
    }
    class aClass implements anInterface {
        method() {
           this // type of 'this' is aClass
        }
        field = (): void => {
           this // type of 'this' is aClass
        }
    }
    class AnotherClass {
        anotherMethod() {
            const obj: aClass = { // Object literal
              method () {
                  this // type of 'this' is aClass
              },
              field: (): void => {
                  this // type of 'this' is AnotherClass

.. _Field Access Expression:

Field Access Expression
***********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Field access expression* can access a class static field (see
:ref:`Accessing Static Fields`) or a field of an object to which an object
reference refers.
An object reference can have different forms as described in detail in
:ref:`Accessing Current Object Fields` and :ref:`Accessing SuperClass Properties`.

.. index::
   field access expression

   syntax

The syntax of *field access expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    fieldAccessExpression:
        objectReference ('.' | '?.') identifier
        ;

A *field access expression* that contains ``'?.'`` (see :ref:`Chaining Operator`)
is called *safe field access* because it handles nullish object references
safely.

If object reference evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the entire
field access expression.

An object reference used to access a field must be a non-nullish reference
type ``T``. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

A field access expression is valid if the identifier refers to an accessible
member field (see :ref:`Accessible`) in type ``T``. A :index:`compile-time error`
occurs otherwise.

Type of a *field access expression* is the type of a member field.

If the identifier in a *field access expression* denotes the accessor defined
for a class or interface type, then either a getter or a setter is called
depending on the position of the *field access expression* (see
:ref:`Accessors with Receiver` for detail).

*Call arguments* are described in :ref:`Call Arguments`.

A method call with ``'?.'`` (see :ref:`Chaining Operator`) is called a
*safe method call* because it handles nullish values safely.

There are several steps that determine and check the entity to be called at
compile time (see :ref:`Step 1 Selection of Type to Use`,
:ref:`Step 2 Selection of Entity to Call`, and
:ref:`Step 3 Checking Modifiers`).

After the type to use is known (see :ref:`Step 1 Selection of Type to Use`),
the set of candidates to call is determined by the form of *object reference*,
*type to use* and the identifier:

                                      with receiver type *T*.
                                      If *T* is a union type, common instance methods

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs set is empty, in other words,
no entity is available to call.

If a set contains more then one entity, then :ref:`Overload Resolution` is used
to select the method or function to call (see :ref:`Overload Set at Method Call`
for details).

A single method to call is known at this step. A set of semantic checks for
each form of method call must be performed as follows:

-  ``typeReference.identifier``

   The method must be declared ``static``. Otherwise,
   a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

-  ``expression.identifier``

   The method must not be declared ``static``. Otherwise,

.. _Function Call Expression:

Function Call Expression
************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Function call expression* is used to call a function (see
:ref:`Function Declarations`), a variable of a function type
(:ref:`Function Types`), or a lambda expression (see :ref:`Lambda Expressions`).

The syntax of *function call expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    functionCallExpression:
        expression ('?.' | typeArguments)? callArguments
        ;

*Call arguments* are described in :ref:`Call Arguments`.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the expression type is one of the
following:

-  Different than the function type;
-  Nullish type without ``'?.'`` (see :ref:`Chaining Operator`).

.. index::
   function call expression

   trailing lambda call

   syntax
   nullish type
   chaining operator
   block
   expression type
   chaining operator

If the operator ``'?.'`` (see :ref:`Chaining Operator`) is present, and the
*expression* evaluates to a nullish value, then:

-  *Call arguments* are not evaluated;
-  Call is not performed; and
-  Result of *function call expression* is not produced as a consequence.

The function call is *safe* because it handles nullish values properly.

.. index::

If the form of expression in the call is *qualifiedName*, and *qualifiedName*
refers to an *overloaded function* (see :ref:`Implicit Function Overloading`
and :ref:`Explicit Function Overload`), then :ref:`Overload Resolution`
is used to select the function to call.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if no function is available to call.

Semantic check for a call is performed in accordance with
:ref:`Compatibility of Call Arguments`.

    function foo() { console.log ("Function foo() is called") }
    foo() // function call uses function name to call it

    call (foo)            // top-level function passed
    call ((): void => { console.log ("Lambda is called") }) // lambda is passed
    call (A.method)       // static method
    call ((new A).method) // instance method is passed

    class A {
       static method() { console.log ("Static method() is called") }
       method() { console.log ("Instance method() is called") }
    }

    function call (callee: () => void) {
       callee() // function call uses parameter name to call any functional object passed as an argument
    }

    ((): void => { console.log ("Lambda is called") }) () // function call uses lambda expression to call it

    let x = foo() // compile-time error as void cannot be used as type annotation

        | trailingLambda
        ;

    argumentSequence:

        ;

The ``callArguments`` grammar rule refers to the list of call arguments. Only
an argument that corresponds to a *rest parameter* can be a spread expression (see
:ref:`Spread Expression`).

.. _Indexing Expressions:

Indexing Expressions
********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Indexing expressions* are used to access elements of arrays (see
:ref:`Array Types`), strings (see :ref:`Type string`), and ``Record`` instances
(see :ref:`Record Utility Type`). Indexing expressions can also be applied to
instances of indexable types (see :ref:`Indexable Types`).

The syntax of *indexing expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    indexingExpression:
        expression ('?.')? '[' expression ']'
        ;

Any *indexing expression* has two subexpressions as follows:

-  *Object reference expression* before the left bracket; and
-  *Index expression* inside the brackets.

.. index::
   indexing expression
   indexable type
   access
   array element
   string
   record
   utility type
   array type
   subexpression
   object reference expression
   index expression
   bracket

If the operator ``'?.'`` (see :ref:`Chaining Operator`) is present in an
indexing expression, then:

-  If an object reference expression is not of a nullish type, then the
   chaining operator has no effect.
-  Otherwise, object reference expression must be checked to a nullish
   value. If the value is ``undefined`` or ``null``,
   then the evaluation of the entire surrounding *primary expression* stops.
   The result of the entire primary expression is then ``undefined``.

If no ``'?.'`` is present in an indexing expression, then object reference
expression must be of array type or ``Record`` type. Otherwise, a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. index::

.. _Array Indexing Expression:

Array Indexing Expression
=========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly
    todo: implement floating point index support - #14001

*Index expression* for array indexing must be one of integer types, namely
``byte``, ``short``, or ``int``. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error`
occurs.


.. index::
   array indexing
   integer type
   index expression
   runtime error
   compilation

The conversion of ``byte`` and  ``short`` types (see
:ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`) is performed on an *index expression* to
ensure that the resultant type is ``int``. Otherwise, a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

Other numeric types (``long``, ``float``, and ``double``/``number``) must be
converted explicitly by applying the methods defined in the classes of the
:ref:`Standard Library`.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    const a = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
    function demo (l: long, f: float, d: double, n: number) {
        console.log (
           a[l.toInt()], a[f.toInt()],
           a[d.toInt()], a[n.toInt()]
        ) // OK to access array using index expression conversion methods
    }


If the chaining operator ``'?.'`` (see :ref:`Chaining Operator`) is present,
and after its application the type of *object reference expression*
is an *array type*,
then it makes a valid *array reference expression*, and the type
of the array indexing expression is ``T``.

The result of an array indexing expression is a variable of type ``T`` (i.e., an
element of the array selected by the value of that *index expression*).

It is essential that, if type ``T`` is a reference type, then the fields of
array elements can be modified by changing the resultant variable fields:

    let names: string[] = ["Alice", "Bob", "Carol"]
    console.log(names[1]) // prints Bob
    names[1] = "Martin"
    console.log(names[1]) // prints Martin

    console.log (names["1"]) // compile-time error as index of non-numeric type

    class RefType {
        field: number = 42
    }
    const objects: RefType[] = [new RefType(), new RefType()]
    const obj = objects [1]
    obj.field = 777            // change the field in the array element
    console.log(objects[0].field) // prints 42
    console.log(objects[1].field) // prints 777

    let an_array = [1, 2, 3]
    let element = an_array [3.5] // compile-time error as index is not integer
    function foo (index: number) {
       let element = an_array [index] // compile-time error as index is not integer
    }

An array indexing expression evaluated at runtime behaves as follows:

-  Object reference expression is evaluated first.
-  If the evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the indexing
   expression, and the index expression is not evaluated.
-  If the evaluation completes normally, then the index expression is evaluated.
   The resultant value of the object reference expression refers to an array.
-  If the index expression value of an array is less than zero, greater than
   or equal to that array’s *length*, then ``RangeError`` is thrown.
-  Otherwise, the result of the array access is a type ``T`` variable within
   the array selected by the value of the index expression.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function setElement(names: string[], i: int, name: string) {
        names[i] = name // runtime error, if 'i' is out of bounds

.. _String Indexing Expression:

String Indexing Expression
==========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly
    todo: return type is string

*Index expression* for string indexing must be of one of integer types, namely
``byte``, ``short``, or ``int``. The same rules apply as in
:ref:`Array Indexing Expression`.

If the index expression value of a string is less than zero, greater than
or equal to that string’s *length*, then ``RangeError`` is thrown.

.. index::

The result of a string indexing expression is a value of ``string`` type.

.. note::
   String value is immutable, and is not allowed to change a value of a string
   element by indexing.

   .. code-block:: typescript

Record Indexing Expression

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Indexing expression* for a type ``Record<Key, Value>`` (see
:ref:`Record Utility Type`) allows getting or setting a value of type ``Value``
at an index specified by the expression of type ``Key``.

The following two cases are to be considered separately:

1. Type ``Key`` is a union that contains literal types only;
2. Other cases.

**Case 1.** If type ``Key`` is a union that contains literal types only, then
an *index expression* can only be one of the literals listed in the type.
The result of the indexing expression is of type ``Value``.

.. code-block-meta:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    type Keys = 'key1' | 'key2' | 'key3'

    let x: Record<Keys, number> = {
        'key1': 1,
        'key2': 2,
        'key3': 4,
    }
    let y = x['key2'] // y value is 2

   record type
   utility type
   value

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if an index expression is not a valid
literal:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    console.log(x['key4']) // compile-time error
    x['another key'] = 5 // compile-time error

The compiler guarantees that an object of ``Record<Key, Value>`` for this type
``Key`` contains values for all ``Key`` keys.

**Case 2.** An *index expression* has no restriction.
The result of an indexing expression is of type ``Value | undefined``.

.. index::
   index expression
   key type
   indexing expression
   literal
   compiler
   restriction


.. code-block-meta:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let x: Record<number, string> = {
        1: "hello",
        2: "buy",
    }

    function foo(n: number): string | undefined {
        return x[n]
    }

    function bar(n: number): string {
        let s = x[n]
        if (s == undefined) { return "no" }
        return s!
    }

    foo(3) // prints "undefined"
    bar(3) // prints "no"

    let y = x[3]

.. index::
   index expression
   literal
   key
   string
   compiler
   value

Type of *y* in the code above is ``string | undefined``. The value of
*y* is ``undefined``.

An indexing expression evaluated at runtime behaves as follows:

-  Object reference expression is evaluated first.
-  If the evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the indexing
   expression, and the index expression is not evaluated.
-  If the evaluation completes normally, then the index expression is
   evaluated.
   The resultant value of the object reference expression refers to a ``record``
   instance.
-  If the ``record`` instance contains a key defined by the index expression,
   then the result is the value mapped to the key.
-  Otherwise, the result is the literal ``undefined``.

Syntactically, the *record indexing expression* can be written by using a field
access notation (see :ref:`Field Access Expression`) if its *index expression*
is formed as an *identifier* of type *string*.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    type Keys = 'key1' | 'key2' | 'key3'

    let x: Record<Keys, number> = {
        'key1': 1,
        'key2': 2,
        'key3': 4,
    }
    console.log(x.key2) // the same as console.log(x['key2'])
    x.key2 = 8          // the same as x['key2'] = 8

.. _Chaining Operator:

Chaining Operator
*****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The *chaining operator* ``'?.'`` is used to effectively access values of
nullish types. It can be used in the following contexts:

- :ref:`Field Access Expression`,
- :ref:`Method Call Expression`,
- :ref:`Function Call Expression`,
- :ref:`Indexing Expressions`.

If the value of ``expr`` in ``expr?.`` is of a *nullish type*,
and is evaluated to ``undefined`` or ``null``,
then the evaluation of the entire surrounding *primary expression*
stops. The result of the entire primary expression evaluation is then
``undefined``. The entire primary expression is then of the union type
``undefined | T``, where ``T`` is a *non-nullish type* of the entire
primary expression:

.. index::
   chaining operator
   field access
   access
   value
   nullish type
   context
   field access
   function call
   indexing expression
   expression
   undefined
   null
   method call
   primary expression
   non-nullish type

.. code-block-meta:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Person {
        name: string
        spouse?: Person = undefined
        constructor(name: string) {
            this.name = name
        }
    }

    let bob = new Person("Bob")
    console.log(bob.spouse?.name) // prints "undefined"
       // type of bob.spouse?.name is undefined|string

    bob.spouse = new Person("Alice")
    console.log(bob.spouse?.name) // prints "Alice"
       // type of bob.spouse?.name is undefined|string

If the value of ``expr`` in ``expr?.`` is not of a *nullish type*,
then the chaining operator has no effect, and does not
influence the type of the entire primary expression:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo(s1: string, s2: string | null) {
        let a = s1?.[0] // 's' is of non-nullish type, type of 'a' is string
        let b = s2?.[0] // type of 'b' is string | undefined
    }

The chaining operator is allowed in a method call expression for instance
methods only. Attempting to use it with a static method is syntactically correct
but causes a :index:`compile-time error`:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   class A {
      static f(): string {return "" }
      g(): string  { return "" }
   }

   let s: string|undefined

   s = A?.f()            // static method, compile-time error

   let b = new A
   s = b?.g()            // non-static method, OK

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if a chaining operator is placed in the
context where a variable is expected, e.g., in the left-hand-side expression of
an assignment (see :ref:`Assignment`) or expression
(see :ref:`Postfix Increment`, :ref:`Postfix Decrement`,
:ref:`Prefix Increment`, or :ref:`Prefix Decrement`).

.. index::
   expression
   chaining operator
   nullish value
   nullish type

   decrement
   increment

If an expression preceding a *chaining operator* is known at compile time to
always evaluate to a nullish value (``undefined`` or ``null``) or a non-nullish
value at runtime, then a :index:`compile-time warning` is issued:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C { f = 1}

    let c = new C()
    c?.f // warning: expression is always non-nullish

    let d: C | undefined = undefined
    d?.f // warning: expression is always evaluated as undefined

The syntax of *new class instance expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    newClassInstance:
        'new' typeReference typeArguments? arguments?
        ;

*Class instance creation expression* specifies a class to be instantiated.
It optionally lists all actual arguments for the constructor.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class A {
       constructor(p: number) {}
    }

    new A(5) // create an instance and call constructor
    const a = new A(6) /* create an instance, call constructor and store
                          created and initialized instance in 'a' */


*Class instance creation expression* can throw an error
(see :ref:`Error Handling`, :ref:`Constructor Declaration`).

A *class instance creation expression* that refers to classes ``FixedArray``,
``Array``, or classes derived from ``Array``, instantiated with an array element
type of some class type, is a special form of *array creation expression*.
When defining multiple elements of a created array, such an array creation
expression must:

- Refer to a class that contains an accessible parameterless constructor
  or a constructor with all parameters of the second form
  of optional parameters (see :ref:`Optional Parameters`); or

- Have a default value.

- Type parameter refers to a concrete type


Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs
(see :ref:`Fixed-Size Array Creation`,
:ref:`Resizable Array Creation Expressions` for details):

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class A<T> {
       foo () {
          const a1 = new Array<T> (5) // Array with 5 elements of type T
                                      // cannot be created
          const a2 = new FixedArray<T> (5) // Array with 5 elements of type T
                                           // cannot be created
       }
    }

The execution of a class instance creation expression is performed as follows:

-  New instance of class is created;
-  Constructor of class is called to fully initialize the created
   instance.

The validity of the constructor call is similar to the validity of the method
call as discussed in :ref:`Step 2 Selection of Entity to Call`, except the cases
discussed in :ref:`Constructor Body`.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if ``typeReference`` is a type parameter.

.. note::
   If a *class instance creation expression* with no argument is used as object
   reference in a method call expression, then empty parentheses ``'( )'`` are
   to be used.

   .. code-block:: typescript
      :linenos:

       class A {  method() {} }

       new A.method()   // compile-time error
       new A().method() // OK
       (new A).method() // OK
       let a = new A    // OK

.. _InstanceOf Expression:

``InstanceOf`` Expression
*************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The syntax of *instanceof expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    instanceOfExpression:
        expression 'instanceof' type
        ;

Any ``instanceof`` expression in the form ``expr instanceof T`` is of type ``boolean``.

.. index::
   syntax
   instanceof expression
   boolean
   operand
   operator
   instanceof operator

The result of an ``instanceof`` expression is ``true`` if the *actual type* of
evaluated ``expr`` is a subtype of ``T`` (see :ref:`Subtyping`). Otherwise,
the result is ``false``.

If type ``T`` is not *preserved up to undefined* by :ref:`Type Erasure`, then a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

*Generic type* (see :ref:`Generics`) in the form of *type name* (see
:ref:`Type References`) can be used as the operand ``T`` of an ``instanceof``
expression. In this case, the check is performed against the *type name*, and
*type parameters* are ignored. *Instantiated generic types* (see
:ref:`Explicit Generic Instantiations`) cannot be used because the operand ``T``
of an ``instanceof`` must be retained by :ref:`Type Erasure`. The ``type`` of
an ``instanceof`` expression is used for *smart cast* (see
:ref:`Smart Casts and Smart Types`) if applicable.

The approach is represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   class A<T> {}
   class B<T> extends A<T> {}

   function foo<T>(a: A<T>) {
      let c = a as B<T>   // OK
      let x = new B<string> // OK, explicit type parameter
      console.log(x instanceof B)        // OK
      console.log(x instanceof B<T>)     // compile-time error, T was erased

      if(a instanceof B) {  // OK, type of instanceOf will be used for smart
                            // cast in `if` clause
         let b = a as B<T>  // OK
      }
   }

   let a = new B<string>()
   foo(a)

If an *instanceof expression* is known at compile time
to always evaluate to ``false`` or ``true`` at runtime, then
a :index:`compile-time warning` is issued:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {}
    class D extends C{}
    class E {}

    function foo(d: D) {
        console.log(d instanceof C) // warning: expression is always true
        console.log(d instanceof E) // warning: expression is always false
    }

The ``type`` of an ``instanceof`` expression is used for *smart cast*
(see :ref:`Smart Casts and Smart Types`) if applicable.

.. _Cast Expression:

``Cast`` Expression
*******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The syntax of *cast expression* is as follows:

.. code-block:: abnf

    castExpression:
        expression 'as' type
        ;

*Cast expression* in the form ``expr as target`` applies the *cast operator*
``as`` to ``expr`` by issuing the value of a specified ``target`` type. Thus,
the type of a cast expression is always the ``target`` type.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class X {}

    let x1 : X = new X()
    let ob : Object = x1 as Object // Object is the target type
    let x2 : X = ob as X // X is the target type

.. index::
   cast expression
   target type
   operand
   cast operator

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the ``target`` type is type ``never``:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    1 as never // compile-time error

.. index::
   never type
   target type

If ``target`` type is not *preserved up to undefined* by :ref:`Type Erasure`,
then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

Two specific cases of a *cast expression* are described in the sections below:

- :ref:`Type Inference in Cast Expression` if ``expr`` is a numeric literal
  (see :ref:`Numeric Literals`), an :ref:`Array literal`, or an
  :ref:`Object Literal`;

- :ref:`Runtime Checking in Cast Expression` otherwise.

If none of conditions stated in these sections are satisfied, then a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. _Type Inference in Cast Expression:

Type Inference in Cast Expression
=================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly

The following combinations of ``expr`` and ``target`` are considered for the
``expr as target`` expression:

-  ``expr`` is a numeric literal, see :ref:`Type Inference for Numeric Literals`
   for detail;

-  ``expr`` is an :ref:`Array Literal`, and ``target`` is an *array type* or
   a *tuple type* (see :ref:`Array Literal Type Inference from Context` for
   detail);

-  ``expr`` is an :ref:`Object Literal`, and ``target`` is *class type*,
   *interface type*, or :ref:`Record Utility Type` (see the subsections of
   :ref:`Object Literal` for detail).

.. index::
   cast expression
   type inference
   expression
   numeric type
   value
   interface type
   record type
   utility type
   class type
   interface type
   object literal

This kind of a *cast expression* results in inferring the target type for
``expr``. This expression never causes a runtime error
by itself. However, the evaluation of array literal elements or
object literal properties can cause a runtime error.

Casting for numeric literals is represented in the
example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let x = 1 as byte // ok
   let y = 128 as byte // compile-time error

.. index::
   inferred type
   type inference
   evaluation
   runtime error
   array literal
   object literal
   cast

Casting for array literals is represented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let a = [1, 2] as double[] // ok, [1.0, 2.0]
   let b = [1, 2] as double // compile-time error, wrong target type
   let c = [1, "cc"] as double[] // compile-time error, wrong element type
   let d = [1, "cc"] as [double, string] // ok, cast to the tuple type
   let e = [1.0, "cc"] as [int, string] // compile-time error, wrong element type

.. note::
   *Assignability* check is applied to the elements of an array literal.

.. index::
   array literal
   assignability

Examples with object literals are provided in :ref:`Object literal`.

.. _Runtime Checking in Cast Expression:

Runtime Checking in Cast Expression
===================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Partly

If :ref:`Type Inference in Cast Expression` cannot be applied, then
``expr as target`` checks if the type of ``expr`` is a subtype of
``target`` (see :ref:`Subtyping`).

If the *actual type* of ``expr`` is a subtype of ``target`` (see
:ref:`Subtyping`), then the result of an ``as`` expression is the result of
the evaluated ``expr``. Otherwise, ``ClassCastError`` is thrown.

If ``target`` type is not *preserved up to undefined* by :ref:`Type Erasure`,
then a check is performed against the *effective type* of the type. As the
*effective type* is less specific than ``target`` in the case described,
the usage of the resulting value can cause type violation, and ``ClassCastError``
is thrown as a consequence (see :ref:`Type Erasure` for detail).

Semantically, a *cast expression* of this kind is coupled tightly with
:ref:`Instanceof Expression` as follows:

.. index::
   runtime check
   cast expression
   target type
   type
   subtype
   subtyping
   type erasure
   check
   effective type

-  If the result of ``x instanceof T`` is ``true``, then ``x as T`` succeeds and
   causes no runtime error;

-  If the result of ``x instanceof T`` is ``false``, then ``x as T`` causes
   ``ClassCastError`` thrown at runtime.

This situation is represented in the following example:

.. index::
   runtime error
   type erasure
   runtime

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function foo (x: Object) {
        x as string
    }

    foo("aa") // OK
    foo(1)    // runtime error is thrown in foo by 'as' operator application

:ref:`Instanceof Expression` can be used to prevent runtime errors. Moreover,
the :ref:`Instanceof Expression` makes *cast conversion* unnecessary in many
cases as *smart cast* is applied (see :ref:`Smart Casts and Smart Types`):

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class Person {
        name: string
        constructor (name: string) { this.name = name }
    }

    function printName(x: Object) {
        if (x instanceof Person) {
            // no need to cast, type of 'x' is 'Person' here
            console.log(x.name)
        } else {
            console.log("not a Person")
        }
    }

    printName(new Person("Bob")) // output: Bob
    printName(1)                 // output: not a Person

.. index::
   runtime error
   operator
   expression
   cast conversion
   smart cast

If the evaluation of a *cast expression* is known at compile time to
always succeed or throw ``ClassCastError`` at runtime, then
a :index:`compile-time warning` is issued:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C {}
    class D extends C {}
    class E extends C {}

    let a: C = new D()
    a as D // compile-time warning: cast always succeeds
    a as E // compile-time warning: cast always throws ClassCastError

.. _TypeOf Expression:

``TypeOf`` Expression
*********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The syntax of *typeof expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    typeOfExpression:
        'typeof' expression
        ;

Any ``typeof`` expression is of type ``string``.

If *typeof expression* refers to a name of an overloaded function or method,
then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

The evaluation of a *typeof expression* starts with the ``expression``
evaluation. If this evaluation causes an error, then the ``typeof`` expression
evaluation terminates abruptly. Otherwise, the value of a ``typeof expression``
is defined as follows:

1. The value of a ``TypeOf`` expression is known at compile time

.. _Ensure-Not-Nullish Expressions:

Ensure-Not-Nullish Expression
*****************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Ensure-not-nullish expression* is a postfix expression with the operator
``'!'``. An *ensure-not-nullish expression* in the expression *e!* checks
whether *e* of a nullish type (see :ref:`Nullish Types`) evaluates to a
nullish value.

The syntax of *ensure-not-nullish expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    ensureNotNullishExpression:
        expression '!'
        ;

If the result of the evaluation of ``expr`` in ``expr!`` is not equal to
``null`` or ``undefined``, then the result of *ensure-not-nullish expression*
is the outcome of the evaluation of ``expr``, otherwise
``NullPointerError`` is thrown.

Type of ``expr!`` is the non-nullish variant of type of ``expr``.

.. note:
    If the expression ``expr`` is not of a nullish type, then the operator ``'!'``
    has no effect.

If an *ensure-not-nullish expression* is known at compile time to always
evaluate at runtime to a non-nullish or a nullish value (``undefined``
or ``null``), then a :index:`compile-time warning` is issued.
The 'NullPointerError' exception is always thrown at runtime in the latter
case as represented below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class C { f = 1}

    let c = new C()
    c!.f // compile-time warning: expression is always non-nullish, operator '!' is ignored

    let d: C | undefined = undefined
    d!.f // compile-time warning: operator '!' always throws 'NullPointerError', as it is applied to nullish value
         // runtime: throws 'NullPointerError'

.. _Nullish-Coalescing Expression:

Nullish-Coalescing Expression
*****************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Nullish-coalescing expression* is a binary expression that uses the operator
``'??'``.

The syntax of *nullish-coalescing expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    nullishCoalescingExpression:
        expression '??' expression
        ;

A *nullish-coalescing expression* checks whether the evaluation of the
left-hand-side expression equals the *nullish* value:

-  If so, then the right-hand-side expression evaluation is the result
   of a nullish-coalescing expression.
-  If not so, then the result of the left-hand-side expression evaluation is
   the result of a nullish-coalescing expression, and the right-hand-side
   expression is not evaluated (the operator ``'??'`` is thus *lazy*).

.. index::
   nullish-coalescing expression
   binary expression
   operator
   evaluation
   expression
   nullish value
   lazy operator

The type of a nullish-coalescing expression is a normalized *union type* (see
:ref:`Union Types`) formed from the following:

- Non-nullish variant of the type of the left-hand-side expression; and
- Type of the right-hand-side expression.

The semantics of a nullish-coalescing expression is represented in the
following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let x = lhs_expression ?? rhs_expression

    let x$ = lhs_expression
    if (x$ == null) {x = rhs_expression} else x = x$!

    // Type of x is NonNullishType(lhs_expression)|Type(rhs_expression)

If the *nullish-coalescing operator* is mixed with a conditional-and
or a conditional-or operator without parentheses, then a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function  foo(n: boolean | undefined, a: boolean, b: boolean) {
        n ?? a || b   // error: '??' and '||' operations cannot be mixed without parentheses
        n ?? (a || b) // ok
    }

If an *nullish-coalescing expression* is known at compile time to always
evaluate to the left-hand-side expression or to the right-hand-side
expression at runtime, then a :index:`compile-time warning` is issued:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a: number = 1
    let b: number | undefined = undefined

    a ?? 2 // warning: left-hand-side expression is always used
    b ?? 3 // warning: right-hand-side expression is always used

Postfix Increment

*Postfix increment expression* is an *expression* followed by the increment
operator ``'++'``.

The *expression* must be a *left-hand-side expression*
(see :ref:`Left-Hand-Side Expressions`), and denotes a variable.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if type of the
the *expression* is not numeric (see :ref:`Numeric Types`) or ``bigint``.

Type of a *postfix increment expression* is the type of the variable. The
result of a *postfix increment expression* is a value, not a variable.

If the evaluation of the operand *expression* completes normally at runtime,
then:

-  Value *1* of the same type as a variable is added to the value of the
   variable; and
-  Result of addition is stored back into the variable.

Otherwise, the *postfix increment expression* completes abruptly, and no
incrementation occurs.

The  value of the *postfix increment expression* is the value of the variable
*before* a new value is stored.

The operation of postfix increment is represented in the following code example:

.. code-block:: typescript

  let a: short  = 1

.. _Unary Plus:

*Unary plus expression* is an expression preceded by the operator ``'+'``.
Type of the operand expression with the unary operator ``'+'`` must be

The result of a unary plus expression is always a value, not a variable (even if
the result of the operand expression is a variable).

Numeric widening occurs on the *expression* before a *unary plus* operator
is applied. The type of the *unary plus* is determined as follows:

.. _Unary Minus:

Unary Minus
===========

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done
    todo: let a : Double = Double.Nan; a = -a; (assertion)

*Unary minus expression* is an expression preceded by the operator ``'-'``.
Type of an operand expression with the unary operator ``'-'`` must be either
convertible (see :ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`) to a numeric type (see
:ref:`Numeric Types`), or of ``bigint`` type. Otherwise,
a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

Numeric widening occurs on the *expression* before a *unary minus* operator is
applied. The type of the *unary minus* is determined as follows:

- Type of result is `int` for ``byte``, ``short``, and ``int``;
- Type of result is the same as that of the initial *expression* for ``long``,
  ``float``, ``double``, and ``bigint``.

The result of a unary minus expression is a value, not a variable (even if the
result of the operand expression is a variable).

The unary negation operation is always performed on, and the result is drawn
from the same value set as the promoted operand value.


.. index::

   operand
   operand value
   normal completion
   value
   variable
   unary numeric promotion
   value set conversion
   unary negation operation
   promoted operand value

Further value set conversions are then performed on the same result.

The value of a unary minus expression at runtime is the arithmetic negation
of the promoted value of the operand.

The negation of integer values is the same as subtraction from zero. The |LANG|
programming language uses two’s-complement representation for integers. The
range of two’s-complement value is not symmetric. The same maximum negative
number results from the negation of the maximum negative *int* or *long*.
In that case, an overflow occurs but throws no error. For any integer value
*x*, *-x* is equal to *(~x)+1*.

The negation of bigint values and subtraction from the value `0n` are the same.

The negation of floating-point values is *not* the same as subtraction from
zero (if *x* is *+0.0*, then *0.0-x* is *+0.0*, however *-x* is *-0.0*).

A unary minus merely inverts the sign of a floating-point number. Special
cases to consider are as follows:

-  Operand ``NaN`` results in ``NaN`` (``NaN`` has no sign).
-  Operand infinity results in the infinity of the opposite sign.
-  Operand zero results in zero of the opposite sign.

.. _Bitwise Complement:

Bitwise Complement
==================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Bitwise complement* operator ``'~'`` is applied to an operand
of a numeric type or type ``bigint``.

If the type of the operand is ``double`` or ``float``, then it is truncated
first to ``long`` or ``int``, respectively.
If the type of the operand is ``byte`` or ``short``, then the operand is
widened to ``int``.
If the type of the operand is ``bigint``, then no conversion is required.
Type of result is determined as follows:

- ``int`` for ``byte``, ``short``, ``int``, and ``float``.
- ``long`` for ``long`` and ``double``.
- ``bigint`` for ``bigint``.

The result of a unary bitwise complement expression is a value, not a variable
(even if the result of the operand expression is a variable).

The value of a unary bitwise complement expression at runtime is the bitwise
complement of the value of the operand. In all cases, *~x* equals
*(-x)-1*.

It is represented by the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript

  let b: byte  = 2
  let s: short  = 2
  let i: int = 2
  let f: float = 2.0f

  let l: long  = 2
  let d: double  = 2.0

  let B: bigint = 2n

  let rb = ~b
  console.log(rb, typeof rb) // prints '-3 int'
  let rs = ~s
  console.log(rs, typeof rs) // prints '-3 int'
  let ri = ~i
  console.log(ri, typeof ri) // prints '-3 int'
  let rf = ~f
  console.log(rf, typeof rf) // prints '-3 int'

  let rl = ~l
  console.log(rl, typeof rl) // prints '-3 long'
  let rd = ~d

``boolean`` or type mentioned in :ref:`Extended Conditional Expressions`.

.. _Multiplicative Expressions:

Multiplicative Expressions
**************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Multiplicative expressions use *multiplicative operators* ``'*'``, ``'/'``,
and ``'%'``.

The syntax of *multiplicative expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    multiplicativeExpression:
        expression '*' expression
        | expression '/' expression
        | expression '%' expression
        ;

Multiplicative operators group left-to-right.

Type of both operands in a multiplicative operator must be as follows:

- Either ``bigint``; or
- Convertible (see :ref:`Numeric Operator Contexts`) to a numeric type
  (see :ref:`Numeric Types`).

Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

.. index::
   multiplicative expression
   multiplicative operator
   syntax
   convertible type
   numeric type

No implicit conversion is applied to a multiplicative expression with operands of
type ``bigint``,  and the inferred type is always ``bigint``.

This behavior is represented by the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript

   // OK, the inferred type of 'i' is ``bigint``
   let i = 1n * 2n
   // Compile-time error, one operand is not of 'bigint' type
   let i = 1n * 2

|

A numeric types conversion (see :ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`) 
of an expression with operands convertible (see :ref:`Numeric Operator Contexts`)
to a numeric type is performed on both operands to ensure
that the resultant type is the type of the multiplicative expression.

The resultant type of an expression with a numeric operand is inferred from
the largest type after promoting ``byte`` and ``short`` operands to ``int``:

- ``double`` if any operand is ``double``;
- ``float`` if any operand is ``float``, and no operand is ``double``;
- ``long`` if any operand is ``long``, and no operand is ``double`` or ``float``;
- ``int`` if all operands are of type ``byte``, ``short``, or ``int``.

    todo: Multiplication of an infinity by a zero should be NaN, but result is - NaN

The binary operator ``'*'`` performs multiplication, and returns the product of
its operands.

Multiplication is a commutative operation if operand expressions have no
side effects.

Bigint multiplication is associative.

Integer multiplication is associative when all operands are of the same type.

Floating-point multiplication is not associative.

Type of a *multiplication expression* with numeric operands
is the *largest* type (see :ref:`Numeric Types`) of its operands *after* aplying
:ref:`Widening numeric conversions`.

If overflow occurs during integer multiplication, then:

-  The result is the low-order bits of the mathematical product as represented
   in some sufficiently large two’s-complement format.
-  The sign of the result can be other than the sign of the mathematical
   product of the two operand values.

A floating-point multiplication result is determined in compliance with the
IEEE 754 arithmetic:

-  The result is ``NaN`` if:

   -  Either operand is ``NaN``;
   -  Infinity is multiplied by zero.

-  If the result is not ``NaN``, then the sign of the result is as follows:

   -  Positive, where both operands have the same sign; and
   -  Negative, where the operands have different signs.

-  If infinity is multiplied by a finite value, then the multiplication results
   in a signed infinity (the sign is determined by the rule above).
-  If neither ``NaN`` nor infinity is involved, then the exact mathematical
   product is computed.

   The product is rounded to the nearest value in the chosen value set by
   using the IEEE 754 *round-to-nearest* mode. The |LANG| programming
   language requires gradual underflow support as defined by IEEE 754
   (see :ref:`Floating-Point Types and Operations`).

   If the magnitude of the product is too large to represent, then the
   operation overflows, and the result is an appropriately signed infinity.

The evaluation of a multiplication operator ``'*'`` never throws an error
despite possible overflow, underflow, or loss of information.

   todo: Division of infinity by infinity should be NaN, but result is - NaN

The binary operator ``'/'`` performs division and returns the quotient of its
left-hand-side and right-hand-side expressions (``dividend`` and ``divisor``
respectively).

Bigint division rounds toward *0*, i.e., the quotient of bigint operands
*n* and *d* is the ``bigint`` value *q* with the largest possible magnitude that
satisfies :math:`|d\cdot{}q|\leq{}|n|`.

If the divisor value of the ``bigint`` division operator is *0n*, then a
:index:`runtime error` is thrown during execution.

Integer division rounds toward *0*, i.e., the quotient of integer operands
*n* and *d*, after a numeric types conversion on both (see
:ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions` for details), is
the integer value *q* with the largest possible magnitude that
satisfies :math:`|d\cdot{}q|\leq{}|n|`.

.. note::
   The integer value *q* is:

   -  Positive, where \|n| :math:`\geq{}` \|d|, and *n* and *d* have the same
      sign; but
   -  Negative, where \|n| :math:`\geq{}` \|d|, and *n* and *d* have opposite
      signs.

The only special case that does not comply with this rule is where integer
overflow occurs. The result equals the dividend if the dividend is a negative
integer of the largest possible magnitude for its type, while the divisor
is *-1*. No error is thrown in this case despite the overflow.

However, if the divisor value of integer division is detected to be *0* during
compilation, then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs. Otherwise, an
``ArithmeticError`` is thrown during execution.

The result of a floating-point division is determined in compliance with the
IEEE 754 arithmetic:

   -  Either operand is NaN;
   -  Both operands are infinity; or
   -  Both operands are zero.

-  If the result is not ``NaN``, then the sign of the result is:

   -  Positive, where both operands have the same sign; or
   -  Negative, where the operands have different signs.

-  Division produces a signed infinity (the sign is determined by
   the rule above) if:

   -  Infinity is divided by a finite value; and
   -  A nonzero finite value is divided by zero.

-  Division produces a signed zero (the sign is determined by the
   rule above) if:

   -  A finite value is divided by infinity; and
   -  Zero is divided by any other finite value.

-  If neither ``NaN`` nor infinity is involved, then the exact mathematical
   quotient is computed.

   If the magnitude of the product is too large to represent, then the
   operation overflows, and the result is an appropriately signed infinity.

    todo: if the dividend is an infinity, or the divisor is a zero, or both, the result should be NaN, but this is -NaN

The binary operator ``'%'`` yields the remainder of its operands (``dividend``
as the left-hand-side, and ``divisor`` as the right-hand-side operand) from an
implied division.

The remainder operator in |LANG| accepts floating-point operands (unlike in
C and C++).

The remainder operation on ``bigint`` operands produces a result value,
i.e., :math:`(a/b)*b+(a\%b)` equals *a*. No implicit conversion is applied
to an operand.

If the divisor value of the ``bigint`` remainder operator is *0n*, then a
:index:`runtime error` is thrown during execution.

The remainder operation on integer operands produces a result value, i.e.,
:math:`(a/b)*b+(a\%b)` equals *a*. Numeric type conversion on remainder
operation is discussed in :ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`.

This equality holds even in the special case where the dividend is a negative
integer of the largest possible magnitude of its type, and the divisor is *-1*
(the remainder is then *0*). According to this rule, the result of the remainder
operation can only be one of the following:

-  Negative if the dividend is negative; or
-  Positive if the dividend is positive.

The magnitude of the result is always less than that of the divisor.

If the divisor value of integer remainder operator is detected to be *0* during
compilation, then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs. Otherwise, an
``ArithmeticError`` is thrown during execution.

The result of a floating-point remainder operation as computed by the operator
``'%'`` is different than that produced by the remainder operation defined by
IEEE 754. The IEEE 754 remainder operation computes the remainder from a rounding
division (not a truncating division), and its behavior is different from that
of the usual integer remainder operator. On the contrary, |LANG| presumes that
the operator ``'%'`` behaves on floating-point operations in the same manner as
the integer remainder operator (comparable to the C library function *fmod*).
The standard library (see :ref:`Standard Library`) routine ``Math.IEEEremainder``
can compute the IEEE 754 remainder operation.

The result of a floating-point remainder operation is determined in compliance
with the IEEE 754 arithmetic:

-  The result is ``NaN`` if:

   -  Either operand is ``NaN``;
   -  The dividend is infinity;
   -  The divisor is zero; or
   -  The dividend is infinity, and the divisor is zero.

-  If the result is not ``NaN``, then the sign of the result is the same as the
   sign of the dividend.
-  The result equals the dividend if:

   -  The dividend is finite, and the divisor is infinity; or
   -  If the dividend is zero, and the divisor is finite.

-  If infinity, zero, or ``NaN`` are not involved, then the floating-point remainder
   *r* from the division of the dividend *n* by the divisor *d* is determined
   by the mathematical relation :math:`r=n-(d\cdot{}q)`, where *q* is an
   integer that is only:

   -  Negative if :math:`n/d` is negative, or
   -  Positive if :math:`n/d` is positive.

-  The magnitude of *q* is the largest possible without exceeding the
   magnitude of the true mathematical quotient of *n* and *d*.

The evaluation of the floating-point remainder operator ``'%'`` never throws
an error, even if the right-hand operand is zero. Overflow, underflow, or
loss of precision cannot occur.

.. _Exponentiation Expression:

Exponentiation Expression
*************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Exponentiation expression uses the binary *exponentiation operator* ``'**'``.

The binary operator ``'**'`` raises the first operand (base) to the power of
the second operand (exponent).

The syntax of an *exponentiation expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    exponentiationExpression:
        expression '**' expression
        ;

The operator ``'**'`` has two variants distinguishable by operand types, i.e.,
both operands are as follows:

- :ref:`Type bigint`; or
- :ref:`Numeric types`, in which case any operand that is not of type ``double``
  is converted to type ``double``.

Any other combination of operand types causes a :index:`compile-time error`.

If the second operand of type ``bigint`` is negative, then a
:index:`runtime error` is thrown.

Both variants of the operator ``'**'`` are represented in example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   let a: bigint = 2n
   let b: double = 2
   let c: int = 2
   let d: int = 10

   let v = a ** 2n // OK 'bigint' ** 'bigint'
   let u = a ** 0n // OK 'bigint' ** 'bigint'
   let w = a ** -1n // Runtime error, exponent must be non-negative

   let x = a ** c // compile-time error, 'c' is not 'bigint'
   let y = b ** d // 'd' is converted to 'double'
   let z = c ** d // both 'c' and 'd' are converted to 'double'


The binary operator ``'**'`` with *numeric operands* is equivalent to
`Math.pow()`. It causes neither a compile-time, nor a runtime error.

Special cases of the binary operator ``'**'`` according to IEEE 754 are
represented below.

.. note::
   Since any numeric operand of ``'**'`` is implicitly converted to ``double``,
   the term ``integer`` effectively means ``double`` with zero in the fractional
   part (for example *-2.0*) as listed below:

   - `x ** +/-0` returns *1* even if *x* is *NaN*;
   - `+/-0 ** y` returns *+/-Infinity* if *y* is a negative odd integer;
   - `+/-0 ** -Infinity` returns *+Infinity*;
   - `+/-0 ** +Infinity` returns *+0*;
   - `+/-0 ** y` returns *+0* if *y* is a finite positive odd integer;
   - `-1 ** +Infinity` returns *1*;
   - `+1 ** y` returns *1* for any *y* (even for *NaN*);
   - `x, +Infinity` returns  *+0* for *-1 < x < 1*;
   - `x, +Infinity` returns *+Infinity* for *x < -1 or for *1 < x*
     (including *+/-Infinity*);
   - `x, -Infinity` returns *+Infinity* for *-1 < x < 1*;
   - `x, -Infinity` returns *+0* for *x < -1* or for *1 < x* (including +/-Infinity);
   - `+Infinity, y` returns *+0* for a number *y < 0*;
   - `+Infinity, y` returns *+Infinity* for a number *y > 0*;
   - `-Infinity, y` returns *-0* for a finite negative odd integer *y*;
   - `-Infinity, y` returns *-Infinity* for a finite positive odd integer *y*;
   - `-Infinity, y` returns *+0* if *y* for a finite *y < 0* and not an odd integer;
   - `-Infinity, y` returns *+Infinity* for a finite *y > 0* and not an odd integer;
   - `+/-0, y` returns *+Infinity* for a finite *y < 0* and not an odd integer;
   - `+/-0, y` returns *+0* for a finite *y > 0* and not an odd integer;
   - `x, y` returns *NaN* for a finite *x < 0* and a finite non-integer *y*.

.. _Additive Expressions:

Additive Expressions
********************

.. meta:

Additive expressions use *additive operators* ``'+'`` and ``'-'``.

The syntax of *additive expression* is presented below:


.. code-block:: abnf

    additiveExpression:
        expression '+' expression
        | expression '-' expression
        ;

Additive operators group left-to-right.

The following rules apply where the operator  ``'+'`` is used:

- If either operand is of type ``string``, then the operation
  is a string concatenation (see :ref:`String Concatenation`).
- If both operands are of type ``bigint``, then no implicit
  conversion is applied, and the inferred type is ``bigint``.
- In all other cases, type of each operand must be
  convertible (see :ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`) to
  a numeric type (see :ref:`Numeric Types`).

Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

The following rules apply where the operator  ``'-'`` is used:

- Either both operands must be of type ``bigint``; or
- Type of each operand of a binary operator must be convertible
  (see :ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`) to a numeric type (see
  :ref:`Numeric Types`).

Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

Type of an *additive expression* with a valid 
combination of types is determined as follows:

-  If any operand is of type ``string``, then ``string``;
-  If both operands are of type ``bigint``, then ``bigint``;
-  If both operands are convertible to a numeric type, then the type inferred
   after widening operands of numeric types by the rules explained in the example
   in :ref:`Multiplicative Expressions`.

String concatenation produces a reference to a ``string`` object that is a
concatenation of two operand strings. The left-hand-side operand characters
precede the right-hand-side operand characters in a newly created string.

If the expression is not a constant expression (see :ref:`Constant Expressions`),

   todo: The sum of two infinities of opposite sign should be NaN, but it is -NaN

A numeric types conversion (see :ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`)
performed on a pair of operands ensures that both operands are of a numeric
type. If the conversion fails, then a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

The binary operator ``'+'`` performs addition and produces the sum of such
operands.

The binary operator ``'-'`` performs subtraction and produces the difference
of two numeric operands.

Type of an additive expression performed on numeric operands is the
largest type (see :ref:`Numeric Types`) to which operands of that
expression are converted (see :ref:`Multiplicative Expressions` for an example).

If the promoted type is ``int`` or ``long``, then integer arithmetic is
performed.
If the promoted type is ``float`` or ``double``, then floating-point arithmetic
is performed.

If operand expressions have no side effects, then addition is a commutative
operation.

If all operands are of the same type, then integer addition is associative.

Floating-point addition is not associative.

If overflow occurs on an integer addition, then:

-  Result is the low-order bits of the mathematical sum as represented in
   a sufficiently large two’s-complement format.
-  Sign of the result is opposite to that of the mathematical sum of
   the operands’ values.

The result of a floating-point addition is determined in compliance with the
IEEE 754 arithmetic as follows:

-  The result is ``NaN`` if:

   -  Either operand is ``NaN``; or
   -  The operands are two infinities of the opposite signs.

-  The sum of two infinities of the same sign is the infinity of that sign.
-  The sum of infinity and a finite value equals the infinite operand.
-  The sum of two zeros of opposite sign is positive zero.
-  The sum of two zeros of the same sign is zero of that sign.
-  The sum of zero and a nonzero finite value is equal to the nonzero operand.
-  The sum of two nonzero finite values of the same magnitude and opposite sign
   is positive zero.
-  If infinity, zero, or ``NaN`` are not involved, and the operands have the
   same sign or different magnitudes, then the exact sum is computed
   mathematically.

If the magnitude of the sum is too large to represent, then the operation
overflows. The result is an appropriately signed infinity.

Otherwise, the sum is rounded to the nearest value within the chosen value set
by using the IEEE 754 *round-to-nearest* mode. The |LANG| programming language
requires gradual underflow support as defined by IEEE 754 (see
:ref:`Floating-Point Types and Operations`).

When applied to two numeric type operands (see :ref:`Numeric Types`), the
binary operator ``'-'`` performs subtraction, and returns the difference of
such operands (``minuend`` as left-hand-side, and ``subtrahend`` as the
right-hand-side operand).

The result of *a-b* is always the same as that of *a+(-b)* in both integer and
floating-point subtraction.

The subtraction from zero for integer values is the same as negation. However,
the subtraction from zero for floating-point operands and negation is *not*
the same (if *x* is *+0.0*, then *0.0-x* is *+0.0*; however *-x* is *-0.0*).

Shift Expressions
*****************

.. meta:

    todo: spec issue: uses 'L' postfix in example "(n >> s) + (2L << ~s)", we don't have it

*Shift expressions* use *shift operators* ``'<<'`` (left shift), ``'>>'``
(signed right shift), and ``'>>>'`` (unsigned right shift). The value to be
shifted is the left-hand-side operand in a shift operator, and the
right-hand-side operand specifies the shift distance.

The syntax of *shift expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    shiftExpression:
        expression '<<' expression
        | expression '>>' expression
        | expression '>>>' expression
        ;

Shift operators group left-to-right.

Both operands of a *shift expression* must be of numeric types
or type ``bigint``.

If the type of one or both operands is ``double`` or ``float``, then the
operand or operands are truncated first to ``long`` or ``int``, respectively.
If the type of the left-hand-side operand is ``byte`` or ``short``, then the
operand is converted to ``int``.
If both operands are of type ``bigint``, then no conversion is required.
A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if one operand is type ``bigint``, and the
other one is a numeric type.
Also, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs if ``'>>>'`` (unsigned right shift)
is applied to operands of type ``bigint``.

The result of a *shift expression* is of the type to which its first operand
converted.

If the left-hand-side operand is of the promoted type ``int``, then only five
lowest-order bits of the right-hand-side operand specify the shift distance
(as if using a bitwise logical AND operator ``'&'`` with the mask value *0x1f*
or *0b11111* on the right-hand-side operand). Thus, it is always within the
inclusive range of *0* through *31*.

If the left-hand-side operand is of the promoted type ``long``, then only six
lowest-order bits of the right-hand-side operand specify the shift distance
(as if using a bitwise logical AND operator ``'&'`` with the mask value *0x3f*
or *0b111111* the right-hand-side operand). Thus, it is always within the
inclusive range of *0* through *63*.

Shift operations are performed on the two’s-complement integer
representation of the value of the left-hand-side operand at runtime.

The value of *n* ``<<`` *s* is *n* left-shifted by *s* bit positions. It is
equivalent to multiplication by two to the power *s* even in case of an
overflow.

The value of *n* ``>>`` *s* is *n* right-shifted by *s* bit positions with
sign-extension. The resultant value is :math:`floor(n / 2s)`. If *n* is
non-negative, then it is equivalent to truncating integer division (as computed
by the integer division operator by 2 to the power *s*).

The value of *n* ``>>>`` *s* is *n* right-shifted by *s* bit positions with
zero-extension, where:

-  If *n* is positive, then the result is the same as that of *n* ``>>`` *s*.
-  If *n* is negative, and type of the left-hand-side operand is ``int``,
   then the result is equal to that of the expression
   (*n* ``>>`` *s*) ``+ (2 << ~`` *s*).
-  If *n* is negative, and type of the left-hand-side operand is ``long``,

Relational expressions use *relational operators* ``'<'``, ``'>'``, ``'<='``,
and ``'>='``.

The syntax of *relational expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    relationalExpression:
        expression '<' expression
        | expression '>' expression
        | expression '<=' expression
        | expression '>=' expression
        ;

Relational operators group left-to-right.

A relational expression is always of type ``boolean``.

The four kinds of relational expressions are described below. The kind of a
relational expression depends on types of operands. It is a
:index:`compile-time error` if at least one type of operands is different from
types described below.

Character Relational Operators
==============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Attempting to use type ``char`` as one operand or both operands in a relational
operator causes a compile-time error if detected at compile time, or a runtime
error otherwise (see :ref:`Character Equality and Relational Operators`).

.. _Numeric Relational Operators:

Numeric Relational Operators
============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Type of each operand in a ``numeric relational operator`` must be convertible
to a numeric type (see :ref:`Numeric Types`,
:ref:`Numeric Conversions for Relational and Equality Operands`), or both operands
must be of a ``bigint`` type (see :ref:`Type bigint`).
.
Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

Depending on the converted type of operands, a comparison is performed as follows:

-  Signed integer comparison, if the converted operand type is ``int``
   or ``long``.

-  Floating-point comparison, if the converted operand type is ``float``
   or ``double``.

-  Bigint comparison, if type of both operands is ``bigint``.

   bigint type
   signed integer comparison
   floating-point comparison
   bigint comparison
   converted type

The comparison of floating-point values drawn from any value set must be accurate.

A floating-point comparison must be performed in accordance with the IEEE 754
standard specification as follows:

-  The result of a floating-point comparison is false if either operand is ``NaN``.

-  All values other than ``NaN`` must be ordered with the following:

   -  Negative infinity less than all finite values; and
   -  Positive infinity greater than all finite values.

-  Positive zero equals negative zero.

   NaN
   finite value
   infinity
   negative infinity
   positive infinity
   positive zero
   negative zero
   IEEE 754

Based on the presumption above, the following rules apply to integer
operands, floating-point operands other than ``NaN``, and ``bigint``
operands:

-  The value produced by the operator ``'<'`` is ``true`` if the value of the
   left-hand-side operand is less than that of the right-hand-side operand.
   Otherwise, the value is ``false``.
-  The value produced by the operator ``'<='`` is ``true`` if the value of the
   left-hand-side operand is less than or equal to that of the right-hand-side
   operand. Otherwise, the value is ``false``.
-  The value produced by the operator ``'>'`` is ``true`` if the value of the
   left-hand-side operand is greater than that of the right-hand-side operand.
   Otherwise, the value is ``false``.
-  The value produced by the operator ``'>='`` is ``true`` if the value of the
   left-hand-side operand is greater than or equal to that of the right-hand-side
   operand. Otherwise, the value is ``false``.

The behavior of comparison of ``numeric`` type operands and
``bigint`` type operands is represented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   //// BigInt against any numeric - always a compile time error
   console.log(1n < 34) // compile-time error

   //// BigInt against BigInt
   console.log(2n < 3n)  // true
   console.log(2n >= 3n)  // false

   // // integer comparisons
   console.log( 1 < -3) // false
   console.log(-1 as long >= -1 as short) // true

   // // floating-point comparisons
   console.log(1 <= 1.0f)  // true
   console.log(2 <= 1.0)   // false

Results of all string comparisons are defined as follows:

-  Operator ``'<'`` delivers ``true`` if the string value of the left-hand-side
   operand is lexicographically less than the string value of the right-hand-side
   operand, or ``false`` otherwise.
-  Operator ``'<='`` delivers ``true`` if the string value of the left-hand-side

   - ``true`` when both operands are ``true``, or the left-hand-side operand
     is ``false`` for any right-hand value;
   - ``false`` when the left-hand-side operand is ``true``, and the

.. _Equality Expressions:

Equality Expressions
********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Equality expressions use *equality operators* ``'=='``, ``'==='``, ``'!='``,
and ``'!=='``.

The syntax of *equality expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    equalityExpression:
        expression ('==' | '===' | '!=' | '!==') expression
        ;

Equality operators group left-to-right.
Equality operators are commutative if operand expressions cause no side
effects.

Similarly to relational operators, equality operators return ``true`` or
``false``.  Equality operators have lower precedence than relational operators,
for example, :math:`a < b==c < d` is `true` when both :math:`a < b`
and :math:`c < d` are ``true``.

Any equality expression is of type ``boolean``.

.. index::
   equality operator
   equality expression
   syntax
   boolean type
   side effect

   relational operator
   precedence

The result produced by ``a != b`` and ``!(a == b)`` is the same in all cases.
The result produced by ``a !== b`` and ``!(a === b)`` is the same.

The result of the operators ``'=='`` and ``'==='`` is the same in all cases
except when comparing the values ``null`` and ``undefined`` (see
:ref:`Extended Equality with null or undefined`).

A comparison that uses the operators ``'=='`` and ``'==='`` is evaluated to
``true`` if:

.. index::
   operator
   comparison
   value
   evaluation

- Both operands are of :ref:`Type boolean` and have the same value;

- Both operands are of :ref:`Type string` or string literal type
  (see :ref:`String Literal Types`) and have the same contents;

- Both operands are of :ref:`Type bigint` and have the same value;

- Both operands are of :ref:`Numeric Types` and have the same value except ``NaN``
  (see :ref:`Numeric Equality Operators` for detail) after a numeric conversion
  (see :ref:`Widening numeric conversions`,
  :ref:`Numeric Conversions for Relational and Equality Operands`);

- Both operands are of :ref:`Type char` and have the same value, i.e., both
  operands represent the same Unicode code point
  (see :ref:`Character Equality and Relational Operators`);

- Both operands are of the same enumeration type (see :ref:`Enumerations`)
  and have the same numeric value or the same string contents, depending on
  the type of enumeration constant values;

- Function references refer to the same functional object (see
  :ref:`Function Type Equality Operators` for detail).

If an *equality expression* is known at compile time to always evaluate
to ``false`` or ``true`` at runtime, then a :index:`compile-time warning`
is issued as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function  foo(b: boolean | undefined) {
        let n: number | boolean = 1
        b == n // warning: expression is always false due to smart cast
        n == 1 // warning: expression is always true due to smart cast
    }

    class B {
        f(): B|undefined { return undefined }
    }
    class D extends B {
        f(): D { return this }
    }

    function bar(c: B) {
        if (c instanceof D) {
            c.f() == undefined // warning: expression is always false
        }
    }

An evaluation of equality expressions always uses the actual types of operands
as in the example below:

.. index::
   comparison
   value
   type
   evaluation
   runtime
   semantics

        return a == b
    }

    equ(1, 1) // true, values are compared
    equ(1, 2) // false, value are compared

    equ("aa", "aa") // true, string contexts are compared
    equ(1, "aa")    // false, not compatible types

    interface I1 {}
    interface I2 {}

    function equ1 (i1: I1, i2: I2) {
       return i1 == i2 // to be resolved during program execution
    }
    class A implements I1, I2 {}
    const a = new A
    equ1 (a, a) // true, the same values


An equality with values of two union types is represented in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    function f1(x: number | string, y: boolean | null): boolean {
        return x == y // compile-time warning: always evaluates to false
    }

    function f2(x: number | string, y: boolean | "abc"): boolean {
        // ok, can be evaluated as true
        return x == y
    }

.. _Numeric Equality Operators:

Numeric Equality Operators
==========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Type of each operand in a ``numeric equality operator`` must be convertible
to a numeric type (see :ref:`Numeric Types`) or to a ``bigint`` type
(see :ref:`Type bigint`) as described in
:ref:`Numeric Conversions for Relational and Equality Operands`.
Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error` occurs.

A widening conversion can occur (see :ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`)
if type of one operand is smaller than type of the other operand (see
:ref:`Numeric Types`).

If the converted type of the operands is ``int`` or ``long``, then an
integer equality test is performed.

If the converted type is ``float`` or ``double``, then a floating-point
equality test is performed.

The floating-point equality test must be performed in accordance with the
following IEEE 754 standard rules:

.. index::
   numeric equality
   numeric equality operator
   widening conversion
   convertible type
   conversion
   value equality

   floating-point equality test

   conversion
   integer equality test
   IEEE 754
   widening
   numeric conversion

-  The result of ``'=='`` or ``'==='`` is ``false`` but the result of ``'!='``
   is ``true`` if either operand is ``NaN``.

   The test ``x != x`` or ``x !== x`` is ``true`` only if *x* is ``NaN``.

-  Positive zero equals negative zero.

-  Equality operators consider two distinct floating-point values unequal
   in any other situation.

   For example, if one value represents positive infinity, and the other
   represents negative infinity, then each compares equal to itself and
   unequal to all other values.

Based on the above presumptions, the following rules apply to integer operands
or floating-point operands other than ``NaN``:

-  If the value of the left-hand-side operand is equal to that of the
   right-hand-side operand, then the operator ``'=='`` or ``'==='`` produces
   the value ``true``. Otherwise, the result is ``false``.

-  If the value of the left-hand-side operand is not equal to that of the
   right-hand-side operand, then the operator ``'!='`` or ``'!=='`` produces
   the value ``true``. Otherwise, the result is ``false``.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   5 == 5 // true
   5 != 5 // false

   5 === 5 // true

   5 == new Number(5) // true
   5 === new Number(5) // true

   5 == 5.0 // true

   integer operand


If *both* operands are of type ``bigint`` and have the same value, then the
operators ``'=='`` or ``'==='`` produce the value ``true``. Otherwise, the
result is ``false``. The result produced by ``a != b`` and ``a !== b``
is the same as the result of ``!(a == b)`` and ``!(a === b)``, respectively.

If one operand is of type ``bigint``, and the other is of a numeric type, then
the result is ``false``.

.. _Function Type Equality Operators:

.. meta:

If both operands refer to the same function object, then the comparison
returns ``true``.
When comparing method references, not only the same method must be used,
but also its bounded instances must be equal.

    function foo() {}
    function bar() {}
    function goo(p: number) {}

Extended Equality with ``null`` or ``undefined``
================================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

|LANG| provides extended semantics for equalities with ``null`` and ``undefined``
to ensure better alignment with |TS|.

If one operand in an equality expression is ``null``, and other is ``undefined``,
then the operator ``'!='`` returns ``true``, and the operator ``'!=='`` returns
``false``:

.. _Bitwise and Logical Expressions:

Bitwise and Logical Expressions
*******************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The *bitwise operators* and *logical operators* are as follows:

-  AND operator ``'&'``;
-  Exclusive OR operator ``'^'``; and
-  Inclusive OR operator ``'|'``.

The syntax of *bitwise and logical expression* is presented below:

    bitwiseAndLogicalExpression:
        expression '&' expression
        | expression '^' expression
        | expression '|' expression
        ;

These operators have different precedence. The operator ``'&'`` has the highest,
while ``'|'`` has the lowest precedence.

Operators group left-to-right. Each operator is commutative if the
operand expressions have no side effects, and associative.

The bitwise and logical operators can compare two operands of a numeric
type, or two operands of the ``boolean`` type. Otherwise, a

.. _Integer Bitwise Operators:

Integer Bitwise Operators
=========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Integer bitwise operators are ``'&'``, ``'^'``, and ``'|'`` applied to operands
of numeric types or type ``bigint``.

If the type of one or both operands is ``double`` or ``float``, then the operand
or operands are truncated first to the appropriate integer type.
If the type of any operand is ``byte`` or ``short``, then the operand is
converted to ``int``.
If operands are of different integer types, then the operand of a smaller type
is converted to a larger type (see :ref:`Numeric types`) by using
:ref:`Widening Numeric Conversions`.
If both operands are of type ``bigint``, then no conversion is required.
A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if one operand of type ``bigint``, and the
other operand is of a numeric type.

The resultant type of the bitwise operator is the type of its operands.

The resultant value of ``'&'`` is the bitwise AND of the operand values.

The resultant value of ``'^'`` is the bitwise exclusive OR of the operand values.

The resultant value of ``'|'`` is the bitwise inclusive OR of the operand values.

Boolean logical operators are ``'&'``, ``'^'``, and ``'|'`` applied to operands
of  type ``boolean``.

If both operand values are ``true``, then the resultant value of ``'&'`` is
``true``. Otherwise, the result is ``false``.

If the operand values are different, then the resultant value of ``'^'`` is
``true``. Otherwise, the result is ``false``.

If both operand values are ``false``, then the resultant value of ``'|'`` is
``false``. Otherwise, the result is ``true``.

Thus, *boolean logical expression* is of the boolean type.

A *conditional-and* operator is fully associative as regards both the result
value and side effects (i.e., the evaluations of the expressions *((a)* ``&&``

.. _Simple Assignment Operator:

Simple Assignment Operator
==========================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The form of a simple assignment expression is ``lhsExpression = rhsExpression``.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs in the following situations:

   - Type of *rhsExpression* is not assignable (see :ref:`Assignability`) to
     the type of a variable referred by the *lhsExpression*; or
   - Type of *lhsExpression* is one of the following:

       - ``readonly`` array (see :ref:`Readonly Parameters`), while the
         converted type of *rhsExpression* is a non-``readonly`` array;
       - ``readonly`` tuple (see :ref:`Readonly Parameters`), while the
         converted type of *rhsExpression* is a non-``readonly`` tuple.

Otherwise, the assignment expression is evaluated at runtime in one of the
following ways:

1. If *lhsExpression* is a field access expression in the form ``e.f`` (see
   :ref:`Field Access Expression`), where *e* is an expression and *f* is
   the name of the field, then:

   #. Expression *e* is evaluated: if the evaluation of *e* completes
      abruptly, then so does the assignment expression.
   #. *rhsExpression* is evaluated: if the evaluation completes abruptly, then
      so does the assignment expression.
   #. After both evaluations complete normally, the value of *rhsExpression*
      is converted to the type of the field *f*, and the result of the
      conversion is assigned to the field *f*.

2. If the *lhsExpression* is an array reference expression (see
   :ref:`Array Indexing Expression`) then:

   #. Array reference subexpression of *lhsExpression* is evaluated. If this
      evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment expression. In
      that case, *rhsExpression* and the index subexpression are not evaluated,
      and no assignment occurs.
   #. If the evaluation completes normally, then the index subexpression of
      *lhsExpression* is evaluated. If this evaluation completes abruptly, then
      so does the assignment expression. In that case, *rhsExpression* is not
      evaluated, and no assignment occurs.
   #. If the evaluation completes normally, then *rhsExpression* is evaluated.
      If this evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment
      expression, and no assignment occurs.
   #. If the evaluation completes normally, but the value of the index
      subexpression is less than zero, or greater than, or equal to the
      *length* of the array, then ``RangeError`` is thrown,
      and no assignment occurs.
   #. If *lhsExpression* denotes indexing of *fixed-size array*, and
      the type of *rhsExpression* is not a subtype of array element type,
      then *ArrayStoreError* is thrown, and no assignment occurs.
   #. Otherwise, the value of the index subexpression is used to select an
      element of the array referred to by the value of the array reference
      subexpression and the value of *rhsExpression* is converted to the type
      of the array element. In that case, the result of the conversion is
      assigned to the array element.

3. If *lhsExpression* is a record access expression (see
   :ref:`Record Indexing Expression`) then:

   #. Object reference subexpression of *lhsExpression* is evaluated.
      If this evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment
      expression. In that case, *rhsExpression* and the index subexpression are
      not evaluated, and no assignment occurs.
   #. If the evaluation completes normally, the index subexpression of
      *lhsExpression* is evaluated. If this evaluation completes abruptly,
      then so does the assignment expression. In that case, *rhsExpression* is
      not evaluated, and no assignment occurs.
   #. If the evaluation completes normally, *rhsExpression* is evaluated. If
      this evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment
      expression. In that case, no assignment occurs.
   #. Otherwise, the value of the index subexpression is used as the ``key``,
      and the value of *rhsExpression* converted to the type of the record
      value is used as the ``value``. In that case, the assignment results in
      storing the key-value pair in the record instance.

If none of the above is true, then the following three steps are performed:

#. *lhsExpression* is evaluated to produce a variable. If the evaluation
   completes abruptly, then so does the assignment expression. In that case,
   *rhsExpression* is not evaluated, and no assignment occurs.

#. If the evaluation completes normally, then *rhsExpression* is evaluated. If
   the evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment expression.
   In that case, no assignment occurs.

#. If that evaluation completes normally, then the value of *rhsExpression*
   is converted to the type of the left-hand-side variable. In that case, the
   result of the conversion is assigned to the variable.

Assignment expressions for different kinds of *lhsExpression* are represented
in the example below:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

   // Case 1: field access lhsExpression
   class A { f: double }
   new A().f = 1

   // Case 2: array indexing lhsExpression
   let b: double[] = [1, 1, 1 ]
   b[1] = 2

   // Case 3: record indexing lhsExpression
   type Keys = 'key1' | 'key2' | 'key3'
   let x: Record<Keys, number> = { 'key1': 1, 'key2': 2, 'key3': 3 }
   x['key2'] = 8

   // None of {field access|array indexing|record indexing}
   let c: double
   c = 1

.. _Compound Assignment Operators:

Compound Assignment Operators
=============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A compound assignment expression in the form:

``lhsExpression op= rhsExpression``

is equivalent to

``lhsExpression = ((lhsExpression) op (rhsExpression)) as T``

where ``T`` is type of *lhsExpression*, except that *lhsExpression*
is evaluated only once.

While the nullish-coalescing assignment (``??=``) only evaluates the right
operand, and assigns to the left operand if the left operand is ``null`` or
``undefined``.

An assignment expression can be evaluated at runtime in one
of the following ways:

1. Where *lhsExpression* is not an indexing expression:

   -  *lhsExpression* is evaluated to produce a variable. If the
      evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment expression.
      In that case, *rhsExpression* is not evaluated, and no
      assignment occurs.

   -  If the evaluation completes normally, then the value of *lhsExpression*
      is saved, and *rhsExpression* is evaluated. If the
      evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment expression.
      In that case, no assignment occurs.

   -  If the evaluation completes normally, then the saved value of the
      left-hand-side variable, and the value of *rhsExpression* are
      used to perform the binary operation as indicated by the compound
      assignment operator. If the operation completes abruptly, then so does
      the assignment expression. In that case, no assignment occurs.

   -  If the evaluation completes normally, then the result of the binary
      operation converts to the type of the left-hand-side variable.
      The result of such conversion is stored into the variable.

2. Where *lhsExpression* is an array reference expression (see
   :ref:`Array Indexing Expression`), then:

   -  Array reference subexpression of *lhsExpression* is evaluated.
      If the evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment
      expression. In that case, the index
      subexpression, and *rhsExpression* are not evaluated,
      and no assignment occurs.

   -  If the evaluation completes normally, then the index subexpression of
      *lhsExpression* is evaluated. If the evaluation completes abruptly,
      then so does the assignment expression. In that case, *rhsExpression*
      is not evaluated, and no assignment occurs.

   -  If the evaluation completes normally, the value of the array
      reference subexpression refers to an array, and the value of the
      index subexpression is less than zero, greater than, or equal to
      the *length* of the array, then ``RangeError`` is
      thrown. In that case, no assignment occurs.

   -  If the evaluation completes normally, then the value of the index
      subexpression is used to select an array element referred to by
      the value of the array reference subexpression. The value of this
      element is saved, and then *rhsExpression* is evaluated.
      If the evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment
      expression. In that case, no assignment occurs.

   -  If the evaluation completes normally, consideration must be given
      to the saved value of the array element selected in the previous
      step. While this element is a variable of type ``S``, and ``T`` is
      type of *lhsExpression* of the assignment operator
      determined at compile time:


      - If ``T`` is a predefined value type, then ``S`` is the same as ``T``.

        The saved value of the array element, and the value of
        *rhsExpression* are used to perform the binary operation of the
        compound assignment operator.

        If this operation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment
        expression. In that case, no assignment occurs.

        If this evaluation completes normally, then the result of the binary
        operation converts to the type of the selected array element.
        The result of the conversion is stored into the array element.

      - If ``T`` is a reference type, then it must be ``string``.

        ``S`` must also be a ``string`` because the class ``string`` is the
        *final* class. The saved value of the array element, and the value of
        *rhsExpression* are used to perform the binary operation (string
        concatenation) of the compound assignment operator ``'+='``. If
        this operation completes abruptly, then so does the assignment
        expression. In that case, no assignment occurs.

      - If the evaluation completes normally, then the ``string`` result of
        the binary operation is stored into the array element.

3. If *lhsExpression* is a record access expression (see
   :ref:`Record Indexing Expression`):

   -  The object reference subexpression of *lhsExpression* is
      evaluated. If this evaluation completes abruptly, then so does the
      assignment expression. In that case, the index subexpression
      and *rhsExpression* are not evaluated, and no assignment occurs.

   -  If this evaluation completes normally, then the index subexpression of
      *lhsExpression* is evaluated. If the evaluation completes abruptly,
      then so does the assignment expression. In that case, *rhsExpression*
      is not evaluated, and no assignment occurs.

   -  If this evaluation completes normally, the value of the object reference
      subexpression and the value of index subexpression are saved, then
      *rhsExpression* is evaluated. If the evaluation completes
      abruptly, then so does the assignment expression. In that case, no
      assignment occurs.

   -  If this evaluation completes normally, the saved values of the object
      reference subexpression and index subexpression (as the *key*) are used
      to get the *value* that is mapped to the *key* (see
      :ref:`Record Indexing Expression`), then this *value* and the value of
      *rhsExpression* are used to perform the binary operation as
      indicated by the compound assignment operator. If the operation
      completes abruptly, then so does the assignment expression. In that case,
      no assignment occurs.

    - If the evaluation completes normally, then the result of the binary
      operation is stored as the key-value pair in the record instance
      (as in :ref:`Simple Assignment Operator`).

.. _Ternary Conditional Expressions:

Ternary Conditional Expressions
*******************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done
    todo: implement full LUB support (now only basic LUB implemented)

The ternary conditional expression ``condition?whenTrue:whenFalse``
uses the boolean value of the first expression (``condition``) to
decide which of other two expressions to evaluate:

.. code-block:: abnf

    ternaryConditionalExpression:
        expression '?' expression ':' expression
        ;

The ternary conditional operator groups
right-to-left (i.e., the meaning of
:math:`a?b:c?d:e?f:g` and :math:`a?b:(c?d:(e?f:g))` is the same).

The ternary conditional operator ``condition?whenTrue:whenFalse`` consists
of three operand expressions
with the separators ``'?'`` between the first and the second expression, and
``':'`` between the second and the third expression.

.. A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the first expression is not of type
   ``boolean``, or a type mentioned in
   :ref:`Extended Conditional Expressions`.

.. index::
   ternary conditional expression
   boolean value
   expression
   ternary conditional operator
   operand
   operand expression
   separator
   boolean type
   extended conditional expression

Type of an expression ``condition?whenTrue:whenFalse`` is determined as follows:

- If the value of ``condition`` is evaluated as ``true`` at compile time, then
  the expression has the type of ``whenTrue``.
- If the value of ``condition`` is evaluated as ``false`` at compile time, then
  the expression has the type of ``whenFalse``.
- If the value of ``condition`` is unknown at compile time, then the expression
  type is a union of types ``whenTrue`` and ``whenFalse`` further normalized
  in accordance with the process discussed in :ref:`Union Types Normalization`.

The following steps are performed as the evaluation of a ternary
conditional expression occurs at runtime:

#. The first operand (``condition``) of a ternary conditional
   expression is evaluated first.

#. If the value of the first operand is ``true``, then the second operand
   expression (``whenTrue``) is evaluated. Otherwise, the third operand
   expression (``whenFalse``) is evaluated. The result of successful
   evaluation is the result of the ternary conditional expression.

The examples below represent different scenarios with standalone expressions:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class A {}
    class B extends A {}

    // Assuming value of `condition` is unknown at compile time
    condition ? new A() : new B() // A | B => A

    condition ? 5 : 6             // int

    condition ? "5" : 6           // "5" | int
    true      ? "5" : 6           // "5"
    false     ? "5" : 6           // int

.. _String Interpolation Expressions:

String Interpolation Expressions
********************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

'*String interpolation expression*' is a multiline string literal, i.e., a
string literal delimited with backticks (see :ref:`Multiline String Literal` for
detail) that contains at least one *embedded expression*.

The syntax of *string interpolation expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    stringInterpolation:
        '`' (BacktickCharacter | embeddedExpression)* '`'
        ;

    embeddedExpression:
        '${' expression '}'
        ;

An '*embedded expression*' is an expression specified inside curly braces
preceded by the *dollar sign* ``'$'``. A string interpolation expression is of
type ``string`` (see :ref:`Type String`).

When evaluating a *string interpolation expression*, the result of each
embedded expression substitutes that embedded expression. An embedded
expression must be of type ``string``. Otherwise, the implicit conversion
to ``string`` takes place in the same way as with the string concatenation
operator (see :ref:`String Concatenation`):

.. index::
   string interpolation expression
   multiline string
   string literal
   backtick

    let a = 2
    let b = 2
    console.log(`The result of ${a} * ${b} is ${a * b}`)
    // prints: The result of 2 * 2 is 4

The string concatenation operator can be used to rewrite the above example
as follows:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let a = 2
    let b = 2
    console.log("The result of " + a + " * " + b + " is " + a * b)

*Lambda expression* fully defines an instance of a function type (see
:ref:`Function Types`) by providing optional annotation usage
(see :ref:`Using Annotations`), optional ``async`` mark
(see :ref:`Async Lambdas`), mandatory lambda signature, and its body. The
declaration of *lambda expression* is generally similar to that of a function
declaration (see :ref:`Function Declarations`), except that a lambda expression
has no function name specified, and can have types of parameters omitted.

Lambda Signature
================

.. meta:

Similarly to function declarations (see :ref:`Function Declarations`),
a *lambda signature* is composed of formal parameters and
optional return types. Unlike function declarations,
type annotations of formal parameters can be omitted.

.. code-block:: typescript

    function foo<T> (a: (p1: T, ...p2: T[]) => T) {}
    // All calls to foo pass valid lambda expressions in different forms

    foo ((e1: Object, e2) => e1)
    foo ((e1: Object, e2, e3) => e1)
    foo ((e1: Object, ...e2) => e1)

    foo ((e1: Object, e2: Object) => e1)

    function bar<T> (a: (...p: T[]) => T) {}

    bar ((...e) => e)

    function goo<T> (a: (p?: T) => T) {}

    goo ((e?) => e)


The specification of scope is discussed in :ref:`Scopes`, and shadowing details
of formal parameter declarations in :ref:`Shadowing by Parameter`.

.. _Lambda Body:

Lambda Body
===========

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Lambda body* can be a single expression or a block (see :ref:`Block`).
Similarly to the body of a method or a function, a lambda body describes the
code to be executed when a lambda expression call occurs (see
:ref:`Function Call Expression`).

The meanings of names, and of the keywords ``this`` and ``super`` (along with
the accessibility of the referred declarations) are the same as in the
surrounding context. However, lambda parameters introduce new names.

If any local variable or formal parameter of the surrounding context is
used but not declared in a lambda body, then the local variable or formal
parameter is *captured* by the lambda.

If an instance member of the surrounding type is used in the lambda body
defined in a method, then ``this`` is *captured* by the lambda.

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if a local variable is used in a lambda
body but is neither declared in nor assigned before it.

If a *lambda body* is a single ``expression``, then it is handled as follows:

-  If the expression is a *call expression* with return type ``void``, then
   the body is equivalent to the block: ``{ expression }``.

-  Otherwise, the body is equivalent to the block: ``{ return expression }``.

If *lambda signature* return type is neither ``void`` (see
:ref:`Types void or undefined`) nor ``never`` (see :ref:`Type never`), and the
execution path of the lambda body has neither a return statement (see
:ref:`Return Statements`) nor a single expression as a body, then a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

-  Lambda return type as the return type of the function type.

.. note::
   Lambda return type can be inferred from the *lambda body* and thus the return
   type can be dropped off.

 .. code-block:: typescript
    :linenos:

      const lambda = () => { return 123 }  // Type of the lambda is () => int
      const int_var: int = lambda()

.. _Runtime Evaluation of Lambda Expressions:

Runtime Evaluation of Lambda Expressions
========================================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The evaluation of a lambda expression itself never causes the execution of the
lambda body. If completing normally at runtime, the evaluation of a lambda
expression produces a new instance of a function type (see
:ref:`Function Types`) that corresponds to the lambda signature. In that case,
it is similar to the evaluation of a class instance creation expression (see
:ref:`New Expressions`).

If the available space is not sufficient for a new instance to be created,
then the evaluation of the lambda expression completes abruptly, and
``OutOfMemoryError`` is thrown.

Every time a lambda expression is evaluated, the outer variables referred to by
the lambda expression are captured as follows:

.. index::
   runtime evaluation
   lambda expression
   lambda body
   execution
   initialization
   function type
   lambda signature
   normal completion
   instance creation expression
   allocation
   class instance
   instance
   abrupt completion
   error
   captured variable
   evaluation


.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

     function foo() {
        let y: int = 1
        let x = () => { return y+1 } // 'y' is *captured*.
        console.log(x())             // Output: 2
     }

The captured variable is not a copy of the original variable. If the
value of the variable captured by the lambda changes, then the original
variable is implied to change:

.. index::
   captured by lambda
   lambda
   variable
   captured variable
   original variable

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

     function foo() {
       let y: int = 1
       let x = () => { y++ } // 'y' is *captured*.
       console.log(y) // Output: 1
       x()
       console.log(y) // Output: 2
     }

Capturing within the function scope is highlighted by the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

     function capturingFunction() { // Function scope
       let v: number = 0 // A captured variable
       return  (p: number) => {
           console.log ("Previous value: ", v, " new value: ", p)
           v = p
       }
     }

     const func1 = capturingFunction ()
     const func2 = capturingFunction ()
     // Note: func1 and func2 are two different function type instances

     func1(11) // Previous value: 0 new value: 11
     func2(22) // Previous value: 0 new value: 22
     func1(33) // Previous value: 11 new value: 33
     func2(44) // Previous value: 22 new value: 44
     /* Note:
           func1 calls work with their own version of variable 'v'
           func2 calls work with their own version of variable 'v'
     */

Capturing within the loop scope is highlighted by the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

     const l = () => {}
     const storage = [l, l, l, l, l]  // fill array with some lambdas

     for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
        storage [index] = () => { console.log ("Index ", index) }
        // Every lambda captures loop index variable
     }
     for (let index = 0; index < 5; index++) {
        storage[index]() // Captured indices printed
     }

.. _Constant Expressions:

Constant Expressions
********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Constant expressions* are expressions with values that can be evaluated at
compile time. If the evaluation *completes abruptly*, then a
:index:`compile-time error` occurs.

The syntax of *constant expression* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    constantExpression:
        expression
        ;

A *constant expression* can be either of a value type (see
:ref:`Value Types`) or of type ``string``, while being composed only of the
following:

-  Literals of a predefined value types, and literals of type ``string`` (see
   :ref:`Literals`);

-  Enumeration type constants;

-  Unary operators ``'+'``, ``'-'``, ``'~'``, and ``'!'``, but not ``'++'``
   or ``'--'`` (see :ref:`Unary Plus`, :ref:`Unary Minus`,
   :ref:`Prefix Increment`, and :ref:`Prefix Decrement`);

-  Casting conversions to numeric types (see :ref:`Cast Expression`);

-  Multiplicative operators ``'*'``, ``'/'``, and ``'%'`` (see
   :ref:`Multiplicative Expressions`);

-  Additive operators ``'+'`` and ``'-'`` (see :ref:`Additive Expressions`);

-  Shift operators ``'<<'``, ``'>>'``, and ``'>>>'`` (see
   :ref:`Shift Expressions`);

-  Relational operators ``'<'``, ``'<='``, ``'>'``, and ``'>='`` (see
   :ref:`Relational Expressions`);

-  Equality operators ``'=='`` and ``'!='`` (see :ref:`Equality Expressions`);

-  Bitwise and logical operators ``'&'``, ``'^'``, and ``'|'`` (see
   :ref:`Bitwise and Logical Expressions`);

-  Conditional-and operator ``'&&'`` (see :ref:`Conditional-And Expression`),
   and conditional-or operator ``'||'`` (see :ref:`Conditional-Or Expression`);

-  Ternary conditional operator ``condition?whenTrue:whenFalse``
   (see :ref:`Ternary Conditional Expressions`);

-  Parenthesized expressions (see :ref:`Parenthesized Expression`) that contain
   constant expressions.
