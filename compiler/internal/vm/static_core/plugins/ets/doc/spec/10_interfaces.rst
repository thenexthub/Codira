Interfaces

An interface declaration declares an *interface type*, i.e., a reference
type that:

-  Includes properties and methods as its members;
-  Has no instance variables (fields);
-  Usually declares one or more methods;
-  Allows otherwise unrelated classes to provide implementations for the
   methods, and so implement the interface.

.. index::
   interface declaration
   interface type
   reference type
   instance variable
   field
   property
   method
   member
   implementation
   class
   interface

Creating an instance of interface type is not possible.

An interface can be declared *direct extension* of one or more other
interfaces. If so, the interface inherits all members from the interfaces
it extends. Inherited members can be optionally overridden or hidden.

A class can be declared to *directly implement* one or more interfaces. Any
instance of a class implements all methods specified by its interface(s).
A class implements all interfaces that its direct superclasses and direct
superinterfaces implement. Interface inheritance allows objects to
support common behaviors without sharing a superclass.

   inheritance

   hiding
   overridden member
   hidden member

The value of a variable declared *interface type* can be a reference to any
instance of a class that implements the specified interface. However, it is not
enough for a class to implement all methods of an interface. A class or one of
its superclasses must be actually declared to implement an interface.
Otherwise, the class is not considered to implement the interface.

The rules of subtyping are discussed in detail in
:ref:`Subtyping for Non-Generic Classes and Interfaces`
and :ref:`Subtyping for Generic Classes and Interfaces`.

Interface Declarations

*Interface declaration* specifies a new named reference type.

The syntax of *interface declarations* is presented below:


.. index::
   interface declaration
   reference type
   syntax

.. code-block:: abnf

    interfaceDeclaration:
        'interface' identifier typeParameters?
        interfaceExtendsClause? '{' interfaceMember* '}'
        ;

    interfaceExtendsClause:
        'extends' interfaceTypeList
        ;

    interfaceTypeList:
        typeReference (',' typeReference)*
        ;

The *identifier* in an interface declaration specifies the interface name.

An interface declaration with ``typeParameters`` introduces a new generic
interface (see :ref:`Generics`).

The scope of an interface declaration is defined in :ref:`Scopes`.

.. The interface declaration shadowing is specified in :ref:`Shadowing by Parameter`.

.. _Superinterfaces and Subinterfaces:

Superinterfaces and Subinterfaces
*********************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

An interface declared with an ``extends`` clause extends all other named
interfaces, and thus inherits all their members. Such other named interfaces
are *direct superinterfaces* of a declared interface. A class that *implements*
the declared interface also implements all interfaces that the interface
*extends*.

.. index::
   superinterface
   subinterface
   extends clause
   direct superinterface
   implementation
   declared interface
   interface
   inheritance

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if:

-  `typeReference`` in the ``extends`` clause refers directly to, or is an
   alias of non-interface type.
-  Interface type named by ``typeReference`` is not :ref:`Accessible`.
-  Current interface is exported but the ``typeReference`` refers to a
   non-exported interface.
-  Type arguments (see :ref:`Type Arguments`) of ``typeReference`` denote a
   parameterized type that is not well-formed (see
   :ref:`Generic Instantiations`).
-  The ``extends`` graph has a cycle.

.. index::
   extends clause

   interface declaration
   interface type
   access
   accessibility
   scope
   type argument
   parameterized type
   generic instantiation
   extends graph
   well-formed parameterized type

If an interface declaration (possibly generic) ``I`` <``F``:sub:`1` ``,...,
F``:sub:`n`> (:math:`n\geq{}0`) contains an ``extends`` clause, then the
*direct superinterfaces* of the interface type ``I`` <``F``:sub:`1` ``,...,
F``:sub:`n`> are the types given in the ``extends`` clause of the declaration
of ``I``.

All *direct superinterfaces* of the parameterized interface type ``I``
<``T``:sub:`1` ``,..., T``:sub:`n`> are types ``J``
<``U``:sub:`1`:math:`\theta{}` ``,..., U``:sub:`k`:math:`\theta{}`>, if:

-  ``T``:sub:`i` (:math:`1\leq{}i\leq{}n`) is the type of a generic interface
   declaration ``I`` <``F``:sub:`1` ``,..., F``:sub:`n`> (:math:`n > 0`);
-  ``J`` <``U``:sub:`1` ``,..., U``:sub:`k`> is a direct superinterface of
   ``I`` <``F``:sub:`1` ``,..., F``:sub:`n`>; and
-  :math:`\theta{}` is a substitution
   [``F``:sub:`1` ``:= T``:sub:`1` ``,..., F``:sub:`n` ``:= T``:sub:`n`].

.. index::
   interface declaration

   superinterface

The transitive closure of the direct superinterface relationship results in
the *superinterface* relationship.

Interface *I* is a *subinterface* of *K* wherever *K* is a superinterface of *I*.
Interface *K* is a superinterface of *I* if:

-  *I* is a direct subinterface of *K*; or
-  *K* is a superinterface of some interface *J* of which *I* is, in turn,
   a subinterface.

There is no single interface to which all interfaces are extensions (unlike
class ``Object`` to which every class is an extension).

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if an interface depends on itself.

.. _Interface Members:

Interface Members
*****************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

An *interface declaration* can contain *interface members*, i.e., its
properties (see :ref:`Interface Properties`) and methods (see
:ref:`Interface Method Declarations`).

The syntax of *interface member* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    interfaceMember
        : annotationUsage?
        ( interfaceProperty
        | interfaceMethodDeclaration
        | explicitInterfaceMethodOverload
        )
        ;

The scope of declaration of a member *m* that the interface type ``I``
declares or inherits is specified in :ref:`Scopes`.

The usage of annotations is discussed in :ref:`Using Annotations`.

.. index::
   interface
   interface member
   interface type
   property
   method
   syntax
   interface declaration
   method declaration
   scope
   inheritance
   annotation

*Interface members* include:

-  Members declared explicitly in the interface declaration;
-  Members inherited from a direct superinterface (see
   :ref:`Superinterfaces and Subinterfaces`).

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if the method explicitly declared by the
interface has the same name as the ``Object``'s ``public`` method.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I {
        toString (p: number): void // Compile-time error
        toString(): string { return "some string" } // Compile-time error
    }

.. index::
   interface
   interface member
   inheritance
   interface declaration
   direct superinterface
   Object
   public method

An interface inherits all members of the interfaces it extends
(see :ref:`Interface Inheritance`).

A name in a declaration scope must be unique, i.e., the names of properties and
methods of an interface type must not be the same (see
:ref:`Interface Declarations`).

.. _Interface Properties:

Interface Properties
********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

*Interface property* can be defined in the form of a field or an *accessor*
(a getter or a setter).

The syntax of *interface property* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    interfaceProperty:
        'readonly'? identifier '?'? ':' type
        | 'get' identifier '(' ')' returnType
        | 'set' identifier '(' requiredParameter ')'
        ;

.. index::
   interface
   property
   field
   accessor
   getter
   setter
   interface property
   syntax

An interface property is a *required property* (see
:ref:`Required Interface Properties`) if it is one of the following:

- Explicit *accessor*, i.e., a getter or a setter; or
- Form of a field that has no ``'?'``.

Otherwise, it is an *optional property* (see :ref:`Optional Interface Properties`).

If ``'?'`` is used after the name of the property, then the property type is
semantically equivalent to ``type | undefined``.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I {
        property?: Type
    }
    // is the same as
    interface I {
        property: Type | undefined
    }

.. _Required Interface Properties:

Required Interface Properties
=============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

A *required property* defined in the form of a field implicitly
defines the following:

-  Getter, if the property is marked as ``readonly``;
-  Otherwise, both a getter and a setter of the same name.

A type annotation for the field defines return type for the getter
and type of parameter for the setter.

As a result, the following declarations have the same effect:

.. index::
   property
   interface
   required property
   interface property
   field
   accessor
   readonly
   getter
   setter
   property
   type annotation
   parameter
   return type

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface Style {
        color: string
    }
    // is the same as
    interface Style {
        get color(): string
        set color(s: string)
    }

.. note::
   A *required property* defined in a form of accessors does not define any
   additional entities in the interface.

A class that implements an interface with properties can also use a field or
an accessor notation (see :ref:`Implementing Required Interface Properties`,
:ref:`Implementing Optional Interface Properties`).

.. index::
   string
   implementation
   required property
   accessor
   interface
   interface property
   optional property
   field
   notation
   property
   entity
   class

|

.. _Optional Interface Properties:

Optional Interface Properties
=============================

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

An *optional property* can be defined in two forms:

-  Short form ``identifier '?' ':' T``; or
-  Explicit form ``identifier ':' T | undefined``.


In both cases, ``identifier`` has effective type ``T | undefined``.

The *optional property* implicitly defines the following:

.. index::
   optional property
   interface property
   identifier

-  A getter (if the property is marked as ``readonly``);
-  Otherwise, both a getter and a setter of the same name.

Accessors have implicitly defined bodies, in this aspect they are similar to
:ref:`Default Interface Method Declarations`.
However, |LANG| does not support explicitly defined accessors with bodies.

The following declaration:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I {
        num?: number
    }
    
-- implicitly declares two accessors:
    
.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I {
        get num(): number | undefined { return undefined }
        set num(x: number | undefined) { throw new InvalidStoreAccessError }
    }

If the default setter is not overridden in a class that implements the interface,
``InvalidStoreAccessError`` is thrown at attempt to set value of an optional
property. See also :ref:`Implementing Optional Interface Properties`.

.. index::
   getter
   setter
   implementation
   value
   optional property
   readonly
   accessor
   body
   interface property

.. _Interface Method Declarations:

Interface Method Declarations
*****************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

An ordinary *interface method declaration* specifies the method name and
signature, and is called *abstract*. Its implicit accessibility is ``public``.

An interface method can have a body (see :ref:`Default Interface Method Declarations`)
as an experimental feature.

.. index::
   interface
   interface method declaration
   method name
   method signature
   method
   declaration
   signature
   interface method
   method body
   abstract declaration

The syntax of *interface method declaration* is presented below:

.. code-block:: abnf

    interfaceMethodDeclaration:
        identifier signature
        | interfaceDefaultMethodDeclaration
        ;


.. index::

.. _Interface Inheritance:

Interface Inheritance
*********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Interface *I* inherits all properties and methods from its direct
superinterfaces. Semantic checks are described in
:ref:`Overriding in Interfaces` and :ref:`Implicit Method Overloading`.

.. note::
   The semantic rules of methods apply to properties because any interface
   property implicitly defines a getter, a setter, or both.

Private methods defined in superinterfaces are not accessible (see
:ref:`Accessible`) in the interface body.

.. index::
   inheritance
   interface

   direct superinterface
   overriding
   method
   superinterface
   semantic check
   private method
   property
   getter
   setter
   access
   accessibility
   interface body

A :index:`compile-time error` occurs if interface *I* declares a ``private``
method *m* with a signature compatible with the instance method :math:`m'`
(see :ref:`Override-Compatible Signatures`) that has any access modifier in the
superinterface of *I*.

.. index::
   interface
   declaration
   method
   private method
   compatibility

The same scheme applies to properties and accessors:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    interface I1 {
        prop1: number
        set prop2 (p: number)
        get prop3 (): number
    }
    interface I2 {
        prop1: number
        set prop2 (p: number)
        get prop3 (): number
    }
    interface I3 extends I1, I2 {}
    // There is only one property prop1, prop2 and prop3 in I3

    function foo (i3: I3) {
       i3.prop1 = 5 // setter for prop1 is called
       i3.prop1     // getter for prop1 is called
       i3.prop2 = 5 // setter for prop2 is called
       i3.prop2     // compile-time error as no getter for prop2
       i3.prop3 = 5 // compile-time error as no getter for prop3
       i3.prop3     // getter for prop3 is called
    }
