Implementation Details

    todo: Implement Type.from in stdlib

Important implementation details are discussed in this section.

.. _Import Path Lookup:

Import Path Lookup
******************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

If an import path ``<some path>/name`` is resolved to a path in the folder
'*name*', then  the compiler executes the following lookup sequence:

-   If the folder contains the file ``index.ets``, then this file is imported
    as a module written in |LANG|;

-   If the folder contains the file ``index.ts``, then this file is imported
    as a module written in |TS|.

.. _Modules in Host System:

Modules in Host System
**********************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

Modules are created and stored in a manner that is determined by the host
system. The exact manner modules are stored in a file system is determined by
a particular implementation of the compiler and other tools.

A simple implementation stores every module in a single file.

.. _Getting Type Via Reflection:

Getting Type Via Reflection
***************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

The |LANG| standard library (see :ref:`Standard Library`) provides a
pseudogeneric static method ``Type.from<T>()`` to be processed by the compiler
in a specific way during compilation. A call to this method allows getting a
value of type ``Type`` that represents type ``T`` at runtime.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let type_of_int: Type = Type.from<int>()
    let type_of_string: Type = Type.from<string>()
    let type_of_number: Type = Type.from<number>()
    let type_of_Object: Type = Type.from<Object>()

    class UserClass {}
    let type_of_user_class: Type = Type.from<UserClass>()

    interface SomeInterface {}
    let type_of_interface: Type = Type.from<SomeInterface>()

If type ``T`` used as type argument is affected by :ref:`Type Erasure`, then
the function returns value of type ``Type`` for *effective type* of ``T``
but not for ``T`` itself:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let type_of_array1: Type = Type.from<int[]>() // value of Type for Array<> 
    let type_of_array2: Type = Type.from<Array<number>>() // the same Type value

.. _Ensuring Module Initialization:

Ensuring Module Initialization
******************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

The |LANG| standard library (see :ref:`Standard Library`) provides a top-level
function ``initModule()`` with one parameter of ``string`` type. A call to this
function ensures that the module referred by the argument is available, and
that its initialization (see :ref:`Static Initialization`) is performed. An
argument must be a string literal. Otherwise, a :index:`compile-time error`
occurs.

The current module has no access to the exported declarations of the module
referred by the argument. If such module is not available or any other runtime
issue occurs then a proper exception is thrown.

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    initModule ("@ohos/library/src/main/ets/pages/Index")

.. index::

.. _Generic and Function Types Peculiarities:

Generic and Function Types Peculiarities
****************************************

The current compiler and runtime implementations use type erasure.
Type erasure affects the behavior of generics and function types. It is
expected to change in the future. A particular example is provided in the last
bullet point in the list of compile-time errors in :ref:`InstanceOf Expression`.

.. _Keyword struct and ArkUI:

Keyword ``struct`` and ArkUI
****************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: Done

The current compiler reserves the keyword ``struct`` because it is used in
legacy ArkUI code. This keyword can be used as a replacement for the keyword
``class`` in :ref:`Class declarations`. Class declarations marked with the
keyword ``struct`` are processed by the ArkUI plugin and replaced with class
declarations that use specific ArkUI types.

.. _Make a Bridge Method for Overriding Method:

Make a Bridge Method for Overriding Method
******************************************

.. meta:
    frontend_status: None

Situations are possible where the compiler must create an additional bridge
method to provide a type-safe call for the overriding method in a subclass of
a generic class. Overriding is based on *erased types* (see :ref:`Type Erasure`).
The situation is represented in the following example:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    class B<T extends Object> {
        foo(p: T) {}
    }
    class D extends B<string> {
        foo(p: string) {} // original overriding method
    }

In the example above, the compiler generates a *bridge* method with the name
``foo`` and signature ``(p: Object)``. The *bridge* method acts as follows:

.. index::
   bridge method
   overriding method
   erased type
   subclass
   compiler
   type-safe call
   generic class
   type erasure
   signature

-  Behaves as an ordinary method in most cases, but is not accessible from
   the source code, and does not participate in overloading;

-  Applies narrowing to argument types inside its body to match the parameter
   types of the original method, and invokes the original method.

The use of the *bridge* method is represented by the following code:

.. code-block:: typescript
   :linenos:

    let d = new D()
    d.foo("aa") // original method from 'D' is called
    let b: B<string> = d
    b.foo("aa") // bridge method with signature (p: Object) is called
    // its body calls original method, using (p as string) to check the type of the argument

More formally, a bridge method ``m(C``:sub:`1` ``, ..., C``:sub:`n` ``)``
is created in ``D``, in the following cases:

- Class ``B`` comprises type parameters
  ``B<T``:sub:`1` ``extends C``:sub:`1` ``, ..., T``:sub:`n` ``extends C``:sub:`n` ``>``;
- Subclass ``D`` is defined as ``class D extends B<X``:sub:`1` ``, ..., X``:sub:`n` ``>``;
- Method ``m`` of class ``D`` overrides ``m`` from ``B`` with type parameters in signature,
  e.g., ``(T``:sub:`1` ``, ..., T``:sub:`n` ``)``;
- Signature of the overridden method ``m`` is not ``(C``:sub:`1` ``, ..., C``:sub:`n` ``)``.
