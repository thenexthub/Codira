/*
 This file tests the experimental TransferNonSendable feature. This feature causes the passing
 of non-Sendable values to isolation-crossing calls to not yield diagnostics during AST passes,
 but to instead emit them later during a mandatory SIL pass. This file in particular checks that
 isolation crossing via argument passing is deferred, but that isolation crossing via returned
 results is not deferred. This is done because flow-sensitive "region" checking
 (see region_based_sendability.code) can determine that objects of non-Sendable type can be safely
 returned as arguments, but not that they can be safely returned.
