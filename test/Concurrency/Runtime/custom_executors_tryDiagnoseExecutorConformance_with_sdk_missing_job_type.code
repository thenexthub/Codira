// NOTE: This test simulates what happens when we have an SDK with some missing concurrency types.
// Specifically, we're missing the ExecutorJob and Job declarations.
// This simulates a pre-Codira-5.9 SDK being used with a Codira 5.9+ compiler,
// which would have failed previously due to missing handling of missing types.
//
// This is a regression test for that situation
