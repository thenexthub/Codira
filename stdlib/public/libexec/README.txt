What is this?
=============

The libexec directory contains the source code for auxiliary executables that
ship with the Codira runtime, as opposed to being part of the toolchain.

On UNIX-like platforms, if the runtime is installed in /usr/lib/language (for
instance), these are things that you would expect to find in /usr/libexec/language.
