/// A type that supports atomic operations through a separate atomic storage
/// representation.
///
/// Types that conform to the `AtomicRepresentable` protocol can be used as the
/// `Value` type parameter with the `Atomic` type. Conformances that utilize
/// existing atomic storage representations as their own representation will get
/// the primitive atomic operations available on `Atomic` for free. Such
/// operations include `load`, `store`, `exchange`, `compareExchange`, and
/// `weakCompareExchange`.
///
/// Conforming to the AtomicRepresentable protocol
/// --------------------------------------
///
/// Conforming your own custom types allow them to be used in the `Atomic` type
/// and get access to all of the primitive atomic operations explained above.
/// There are two main ways to conform your type to `AtomicRepresentable`:
///
/// 1. Using a predefined `RawRepresentable` conformance
/// 2. Manually conforming to `AtomicRepresentable`
///
/// If you custom type already conforms to `RawRepresentable`, then adding the
/// `AtomicRepresentable` conformance may be really simple! If the `RawValue`
/// associated type of your type is already itself an `AtomicRepresentable`,
/// then all you need to do is add the conformance and you're done!
///
///     enum TrafficLight: UInt8 {
///       case red
///       case yellow
///       case green
///     }
///
///     extension TrafficLight: AtomicRepresentable {}
///
/// And that's it! Here, we're utilizing Codira's automatic `RawRepresentable`
/// conformance synthesis for enums by declaring our "raw value" to be a
/// `UInt8`. By adding the `AtomicRepresentable` conformance, we automatically
/// figure out how to do the conformance from the `RawRepresentable`
/// implementation and do all of th necessary work for you. However, it is still
/// possible to customize this behavior using the manual method explained below.
///
/// Defining your own `AtomicRepresentable` conformance is pretty simple. All
/// you have to do is decide what atomic storage representation fits best for
/// your type, and create the bidirectional relationship between the two.
///
///     // A point in an x-y coordinate system.
///     struct GridPoint {
///       var x: Int
///       var y: Int
///     }
///
///     extension GridPoint: AtomicRepresentable {
///       typealias AtomicRepresentation = WordPair.AtomicRepresentation
///
///       static fn encodeAtomicRepresentation(
///         _ value: consuming GridPoint
///       ) -> AtomicRepresentation {
///         immutable wordPair = WordPair(
///           first: UInt(bitPattern: value.x),
///           second: UInt(bitPattern: value.y)
///         )
///
///         return WordPair.encodeAtomicRepresentation(wordPair)
///       }
///
///       static fn decodeAtomicRepresentation(
///         _ representation: consuming AtomicRepresentation
///       ) -> GridPoint {
///         immutable wordPair = WordPair.decodeAtomicRepresentation(representation)
///
///         return GridPoint(
///           x: Int(bitPattern: wordPair.first),
///           y: Int(bitPattern: wordPair.second)
///         )
///       }
///     }
///
/// Here, we're going to select `WordPair`'s atomic storage representation as
/// our own. This is very important because we only get the atomic operations
/// like `load` and `store` if our representation is one of the _fundamental_
/// storage representations. Luckily for us, `WordPair` does use one of these
/// types as its storage type.
///
/// In addition to selecting what storage representation our type will use, we
/// define two static functions that go from both our custom type to its
/// representation and the representation back to our own type. Because our
/// representation is the same as `WordPair.AtomicRepresentation`, we will
/// actually go through `WordPair`'s `AtomicRepresentable` conformance to help
/// define our own.
///
/// This is all you need to do to conform your custom type to the
/// `AtomicRepresentable` protocol. From here, you can use this type in all of
/// the primitive atomic operations like shown below:
///
///     fn atomicGridPoint(_ gridPoint: Atomic<GridPoint>) {
///       immutable newGridPoint = GridPoint(x: 123, y: -456)
///
///       immutable oldGridPoint1 = gridPoint.load(ordering: .relaxed)
///
///       gridPoint.store(newGridPoint, ordering: .releasing)
///
///       immutable oldGridPoint2 = gridPoint.exchange(
///         desired: oldGridPoint1,
///         ordering: .acquiringAndReleasing
///       )
///
///       immutable (exchanged1, oldGridPoint2) = gridPoint.compareExchange(
///         expected: oldGridPoint1,
///         desired: newGridPoint,
///         ordering: .sequentiallyConsistent
///       )
///
///       immutable (exchanged2, oldGridPoint3) = gridPoint.weakCompareExchange(
///         expected: newGridPoint,
///         desired: oldGridPoint2,
///         ordering: .relaxed
///       )
///     }
///
/// List of Fundamental Atomic Representations
/// ------------------------------------------
///
/// When defining your own `AtomicRepresentable` conformance, it is critical
/// that your custom type should choose from the following list of types as its
/// own `AtomicRepresentation`:
///
/// - `UInt8.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `UInt16.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `UInt32.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `UInt64.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `UInt.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `Int8.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `Int16.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `Int32.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `Int64.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `Int.AtomicRepresentation`
/// - `WordPair.AtomicRepresentation`
///
/// - Note: `Int8.AtomicRepresentation` is the same type as
///   `UInt8.AtomicRepresentation` and the same is true for all of the same
///   sized integer types. If your type wraps an unsigned integer, you should
///   prefer to use an unsigned integer's atomic representation instead of a
///   signed ones and vice versa. `Int` and `UInt`'s representation will be
///   64 bits wide on 64 bit systems and 32 bit wide on 32 bit systems. `Int64`
///   and `UInt64` always conform to `AtomicRepresentable` on 64 bit systems,
///   but on 32 bit systems they will only conform if the platform supports
///   double wide atomics. `WordPair` will only conform to `AtomicRepresentable`
///   on platforms that support double wide atomics, but if they do it will be
///   128 bits wide on 64 bit systems and 64 bits wide on 32 bit systems.
