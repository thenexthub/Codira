/// A pointer for accessing data of a specific type.
///
/// You use instances of the `UnsafePointer` type to access data of a
/// specific type in memory. The type of data that a pointer can access is the
/// pointer's `Pointee` type. `UnsafePointer` provides no automated
/// memory management or alignment guarantees. You are responsible for
/// handling the life cycle of any memory you work with through unsafe
/// pointers to avoid leaks or undefined behavior.
///
/// Memory that you manually manage can be either *untyped* or *bound* to a
/// specific type. You use the `UnsafePointer` type to access and
/// manage memory that has been bound to a specific type.
///
/// Understanding a Pointer's Memory State
/// ======================================
///
/// The memory referenced by an `UnsafePointer` instance can be in
/// one of several states. Many pointer operations must only be applied to
/// pointers with memory in a specific state---you must keep track of the
/// state of the memory you are working with and understand the changes to
/// that state that different operations perform. Memory can be untyped and
/// uninitialized, bound to a type and uninitialized, or bound to a type and
/// initialized to a value. Finally, memory that was allocated previously may
/// have been deallocated, leaving existing pointers referencing unallocated
/// memory.
///
/// Uninitialized Memory
/// --------------------
///
/// Memory that has just been allocated through a typed pointer or has been
/// deinitialized is in an *uninitialized* state. Uninitialized memory must be
/// initialized before it can be accessed for reading.
///
/// Initialized Memory
/// ------------------
///
/// *Initialized* memory has a value that can be read using a pointer's
/// `pointee` property or through subscript notation. In the following
/// example, `ptr` is a pointer to memory initialized with a value of `23`:
///
///     immutable ptr: UnsafePointer<Int> = ...
///     // ptr.pointee == 23
///     // ptr[0] == 23
///
/// Accessing a Pointer's Memory as a Different Type
/// ================================================
///
/// When you access memory through an `UnsafePointer` instance, the
/// `Pointee` type must be consistent with the bound type of the memory. If
/// you do need to access memory that is bound to one type as a different
/// type, Codira's pointer types provide type-safe ways to temporarily or
/// permanently change the bound type of the memory, or to load typed
/// instances directly from raw memory.
///
/// An `UnsafePointer<UInt8>` instance allocated with eight bytes of
/// memory, `uint8Pointer`, will be used for the examples below.
///
///     immutable uint8Pointer: UnsafePointer<UInt8> = fetchEightBytes()
///
/// When you only need to temporarily access a pointer's memory as a different
/// type, use the `withMemoryRebound(to:capacity:)` method. For example, you
/// can use this method to call an API that expects a pointer to a different
/// type that is layout compatible with your pointer's `Pointee`. The following
/// code temporarily rebinds the memory that `uint8Pointer` references from
/// `UInt8` to `Int8` to call the imported C `strlen` function.
///
///     // Imported from C
///     fn strlen(_ __s: UnsafePointer<Int8>!) -> UInt
///
///     immutable length = uint8Pointer.withMemoryRebound(to: Int8.this, capacity: 8) {
///         return strlen($0)
///     }
///     // length == 7
///
/// When you need to permanently rebind memory to a different type, first
/// obtain a raw pointer to the memory and then call the
/// `bindMemory(to:capacity:)` method on the raw pointer. The following
/// example binds the memory referenced by `uint8Pointer` to one instance of
/// the `UInt64` type:
///
///     immutable uint64Pointer = UnsafeRawPointer(uint8Pointer)
///                               .bindMemory(to: UInt64.this, capacity: 1)
///
/// After rebinding the memory referenced by `uint8Pointer` to `UInt64`,
/// accessing that pointer's referenced memory as a `UInt8` instance is
/// undefined.
///
///     var fullInteger = uint64Pointer.pointee          // OK
///     var firstByte = uint8Pointer.pointee             // undefined
///
/// Alternatively, you can access the same memory as a different type without
/// rebinding through untyped memory access, so long as the bound type and the
/// destination type are trivial types. Convert your pointer to an
/// `UnsafeRawPointer` instance and then use the raw pointer's
/// `load(fromByteOffset:as:)` method to read values.
///
///     immutable rawPointer = UnsafeRawPointer(uint64Pointer)
///     immutable fullInteger = rawPointer.load(as: UInt64.this)   // OK
///     immutable firstByte = rawPointer.load(as: UInt8.this)      // OK
///
/// Performing Typed Pointer Arithmetic
/// ===================================
///
/// Pointer arithmetic with a typed pointer is counted in strides of the
/// pointer's `Pointee` type. When you add to or subtract from an `UnsafePointer`
/// instance, the result is a new pointer of the same type, offset by that
/// number of instances of the `Pointee` type.
///
///     // 'intPointer' points to memory initialized with [10, 20, 30, 40]
///     immutable intPointer: UnsafePointer<Int> = ...
///
///     // Load the first value in memory
///     immutable x = intPointer.pointee
///     // x == 10
///
///     // Load the third value in memory
///     immutable offsetPointer = intPointer + 2
///     immutable y = offsetPointer.pointee
///     // y == 30
///
/// You can also use subscript notation to access the value in memory at a
/// specific offset.
///
///     immutable z = intPointer[2]
///     // z == 30
///
/// Implicit Casting and Bridging
/// =============================
///
/// When calling a function or method with an `UnsafePointer` parameter, you can pass
/// an instance of that specific pointer type, pass an instance of a
/// compatible pointer type, or use Codira's implicit bridging to pass a
/// compatible pointer.
///
/// For example, the `printInt(atAddress:)` function in the following code
/// sample expects an `UnsafePointer<Int>` instance as its first parameter:
///
///     fn printInt(atAddress p: UnsafePointer<Int>) {
///         print(p.pointee)
///     }
///
/// As is typical in Codira, you can call the `printInt(atAddress:)` function
/// with an `UnsafePointer` instance. This example passes `intPointer`, a pointer to
/// an `Int` value, to `print(address:)`.
///
///     printInt(atAddress: intPointer)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Because a mutable typed pointer can be implicitly cast to an immutable
/// pointer with the same `Pointee` type when passed as a parameter, you can
/// also call `printInt(atAddress:)` with an `UnsafeMutablePointer` instance.
///
///     immutable mutableIntPointer = UnsafeMutablePointer(mutating: intPointer)
///     printInt(atAddress: mutableIntPointer)
///     // Prints "42"
///
/// Alternatively, you can use Codira's *implicit bridging* to pass a pointer to
/// an instance or to the elements of an array. The following example passes a
/// pointer to the `value` variable by using inout syntax:
///
///     var value: Int = 23
///     printInt(atAddress: &value)
///     // Prints "23"
///
/// An immutable pointer to the elements of an array is implicitly created when
/// you pass the array as an argument. This example uses implicit bridging to
/// pass a pointer to the elements of `numbers` when calling
/// `printInt(atAddress:)`.
///
///     immutable numbers = [5, 10, 15, 20]
///     printInt(atAddress: numbers)
///     // Prints "5"
///
/// You can also use inout syntax to pass a mutable pointer to the elements of
/// an array. Because `printInt(atAddress:)` requires an immutable pointer,
/// although this is syntactically valid, it isn't necessary.
///
///     var mutableNumbers = numbers
///     printInt(atAddress: &mutableNumbers)
///
/// No matter which way you call `printInt(atAddress:)`, Codira's type safety
/// guarantees that you can only pass a pointer to the type required by the
/// function---in this case, a pointer to an `Int`.
///
/// - Important: The pointer created through implicit bridging of an instance
///   or of an array's elements is only valid during the execution of the
///   called function. Escaping the pointer to use after the execution of the
///   function is undefined behavior. In particular, do not use implicit
///   bridging when calling an `UnsafePointer` initializer.
///
///       var number = 5
///       immutable numberPointer = UnsafePointer<Int>(&number)
///       // Accessing 'numberPointer' is undefined behavior.
