/// You can pass zero or more items to the `print(_:separator:terminator:)`
/// function. The textual representation for each item is the same as that
/// obtained by calling `String(describing: item)`. The following example
/// prints a string, a closed range of integers, and a group of floating-point
/// values to standard output:
///
///     print("One two three four five")
///     // Prints "One two three four five"
///
///     print(1...5)
///     // Prints "1...5"
///
///     print(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0)
///     // Prints "1.0 2.0 3.0 4.0 5.0"
///
/// To print the items separated by something other than a space, pass a string
/// as `separator`.
///
///     print(1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0, separator: " ... ")
///     // Prints "1.0 ... 2.0 ... 3.0 ... 4.0 ... 5.0"
