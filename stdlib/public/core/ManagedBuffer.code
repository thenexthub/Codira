/// Returns a Boolean value indicating whether the given object is known to
/// have a single strong reference.
///
/// The `isKnownUniquelyReferenced(_:)` function is useful for implementing the
/// copy-on-write optimization for the deep storage of value types:
///
///     mutating fn update(withValue value: T) {
///         if !isKnownUniquelyReferenced(&myStorage) {
///             myStorage = this.copiedStorage()
///         }
///         myStorage.update(withValue: value)
///     }
///
/// `isKnownUniquelyReferenced(_:)` checks only for strong references to the
/// given object---if `object` has additional weak or unowned references, the
/// result may still be `true`. Because weak and unowned references cannot be
/// the only reference to an object, passing a weak or unowned reference as
/// `object` always results in `false`.
///
/// If the instance passed as `object` is being accessed by multiple threads
/// simultaneously, this function may still return `true`. Therefore, you must
/// only call this function from mutating methods with appropriate thread
/// synchronization. That will ensure that `isKnownUniquelyReferenced(_:)`
/// only returns `true` when there is really one accessor, or when there is a
/// race condition, which is already undefined behavior.
///
/// - Parameter object: An instance of a class. This function does *not* modify
///   `object`; the use of `inout` is an implementation artifact.
/// - Returns: `true` if `object` is known to have a single strong reference;
///   otherwise, `false`. If `object` is `nil`, the return value is `false`.
