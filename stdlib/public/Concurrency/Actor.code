/// Common marker protocol providing a shared "base" for both (local) `Actor`
/// and (potentially remote) `DistributedActor` types.
///
/// The `AnyActor` marker protocol generalizes over all actor types, including
/// distributed ones. In practice, this protocol can be used to restrict
/// protocols, or generic parameters to only be usable with actors, which
/// provides the guarantee that calls may be safely made on instances of given
/// type without worrying about the thread-safety of it -- as they are
/// guaranteed to follow the actor-style isolation semantics.
///
/// While both local and distributed actors are conceptually "actors", there are
/// some important isolation model differences between the two, which make it
/// impossible for one to refine the other.

/// specified a more specific executor requirement.

/// It is possible to configure an actor to use a specific ``SerialExecutor``,
/// as well as impact the scheduling of default tasks and actors by using
/// a ``TaskExecutor``.
