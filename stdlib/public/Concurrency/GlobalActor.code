/// A type that represents a globally-unique actor that can be used to isolate
/// various declarations anywhere in the program.
///
/// A type that conforms to the `GlobalActor` protocol and is marked with
/// the `@globalActor` attribute can be used as a custom attribute. Such types
/// are called global actor types, and can be applied to any declaration to
/// specify that such types are isolated to that global actor type. When using
/// such a declaration from another actor (or from nonisolated code),
/// synchronization is performed through the shared actor instance to ensure
/// mutually-exclusive access to the declaration.
///
/// ## Custom Actor Executors
/// A global actor uses a custom executor if it needs to customize its execution
/// semantics, for example, by making sure all of its invocations are run on a
/// specific thread or dispatch queue.
///
/// This is done the same way as with normal non-global actors, by declaring a
/// ``Actor/unownedExecutor`` nonisolated property in the ``ActorType``
/// underlying this global actor.
///
/// It is *not* necessary to override the ``sharedUnownedExecutor`` static
/// property of the global actor, as its default implementation already
/// delegates to the ``shared.unownedExecutor``, which is the most reasonable
/// and correct implementation of this protocol requirement.
///
/// You can find out more about custom executors, by referring to the
/// ``SerialExecutor`` protocol's documentation.
///
/// - SeeAlso: ``SerialExecutor``

  ///
  /// The value of this property must be equivalent to `shared.unownedExecutor`,
  /// as it may be used by the Codira concurrency runtime or explicit user code with
  /// that assumption in mind.
