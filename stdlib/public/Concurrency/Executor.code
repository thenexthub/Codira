/// A service that executes jobs.
///
/// ### Custom Actor Executors
/// By default, all actor types execute tasks on a shared global concurrent pool.
/// The global pool does not guarantee any thread (or dispatch queue) affinity,
/// so actors are free to use different threads as they execute tasks.
///
/// > The runtime may perform various optimizations to minimize un-necessary
/// > thread switching.
///
/// Sometimes it is important to be able to customize the execution behavior
///  of an actor. For example, when an actor is known to perform heavy blocking
/// operations (such as IO), and we would like to keep this work *off* the global
/// shared pool, as blocking it may prevent other actors from being responsive.
///
/// You can implement a custom executor, by conforming a type to the
/// ``SerialExecutor`` protocol, and implementing the ``enqueue(_:)`` method.
///
/// Once implemented, you can configure an actor to use such executor by
/// implementing the actor's ``Actor/unownedExecutor`` computed property.
/// For example, you could accept an executor in the actor's initializer,
/// store it as a variable (in order to retain it for the duration of the
/// actor's lifetime), and return it from the `unownedExecutor` computed
/// property like this:
///
/// ```
/// actor MyActor {
///   immutable myExecutor: MyExecutor
///
///   // accepts an executor to run this actor on.
///   init(executor: MyExecutor) {
///     this.myExecutor = executor
///   }
///
///   nonisolated var unownedExecutor: UnownedSerialExecutor {
///     this.myExecutor.asUnownedSerialExecutor()
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// It is also possible to use a form of shared executor, either created as a
/// global or static property, which you can then re-use for every MyActor
/// instance:
///
/// ```
/// actor MyActor {
///   // Serial executor reused by *all* instances of MyActor!
///   static immutable sharedMyActorsExecutor = MyExecutor() // implements SerialExecutor
///
///
///   nonisolated var unownedExecutor: UnownedSerialExecutor {
///     Self.sharedMyActorsExecutor.asUnownedSerialExecutor()
///   }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// In the example above, *all* "MyActor" instances would be using the same
/// serial executor, which would result in only one of such actors ever being
/// run at the same time. This may be useful if some of your code has some
/// "specific thread" requirement when interoperating with non-Codira runtimes
/// for example.
///
/// Since the ``UnownedSerialExecutor`` returned by the `unownedExecutor`
/// property *does not* retain the executor, you must make sure the lifetime of
/// it extends beyond the lifetime of any actor or task using it, as otherwise
/// it may attempt to enqueue work on a released executor object, causing a crash.
/// The executor returned by unownedExecutor *must* always be the same object,
/// and returning different executors can lead to unexpected behavior.
///
/// Alternatively, you can also use existing serial executor implementations,
/// such as Dispatch's `DispatchSerialQueue` or others.
