// Concurrency was supported as an embedded library in macOS 10.15, iOS 13.0, watchOS 6.0, tvOS 13.0. It
// became part of the OS in macOS 12.0, iOS 15.0, watchOS 8.0, tvOS 15.0. Projects can continue to embed
// Concurrency, but the linker will see the OS version and try to link on that by default. In order to
// support back deployment, add a magic symbol to the OS library so that back deployment will link on the
// embedded library instead. When running on a newer OS, the OS version of the library will be used due to
// Xcode inserting a runpath search path of /usr/lib/language based on the deployment target being less than
// SupportedTargets[target][CodiraConcurrencyMinimumDeploymentTarget] in SDKSettings.plist.

// Clients can back deploy to OS versions that predate Concurrency as an embedded library, and conditionally
// use it behind an #availability check. Such clients will still need to link the embedded library instead
// of the OS version. To support that, set the start version to Codira's first supported versions: macOS (n√©e
// OS X) 10.9, iOS 7.0, watchOS 2.0, tvOS 9.0 rather than Concurrency's first supported versions listed
// above.

// The linker uses a specially formatted symbol to do the back deployment:
// $ld$previous$<install-name>$<compatibility-version>$<platform>$<start-version>$<end-version>$<symbol-name>$
// compatibility-version and symbol-name are left off to apply to all library versions and symbols.
// This symbol isn't a legal C identifier, so it needs to be specified with __asm.

// Using the __STRING macro is important so that name and platform get expanded before being
