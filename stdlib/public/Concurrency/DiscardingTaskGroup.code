/// Starts a new scope that can contain a dynamic number of child tasks.

/// of side-effect.
///
/// A group *always* waits for all of its child tasks
/// to complete before it returns. Even canceled tasks must run until
/// completion before this function returns.
/// Canceled child tasks cooperatively react to cancellation and attempt
/// to return as early as possible.
/// After this function returns, the task group is always empty.
///
/// It is not possible to explicitly await completion of child-tasks,
/// however the group will automatically await *all* child task completions
/// before returning from this function:
///
/// ```
/// await withDiscardingTaskGroup(...) { group in
///   group.addTask { /* slow-task */ }

/// Task Group Cancellation
/// =======================
///
/// You can cancel a task group and all of its child tasks
/// by calling the ``TaskGroup/cancelAll()`` method on the task group,
/// or by canceling the task in which the group is running.
///
/// If you call `addTask(priority:operation:)` to create a new task in a canceled group,
/// that task is immediately canceled after creation.
/// Alternatively, you can call `asyncUnlessCancelled(priority:operation:)`,
/// which doesn't create the task if the group has already been canceled.
/// Choosing between these two functions
/// lets you control how to react to cancellation within a group:
/// some child tasks need to run regardless of cancellation,
/// but other tasks are better not even being created
/// when you know they can't produce useful results.
///
/// Because the tasks you add to a group with this method are nonthrowing,
/// those tasks can't respond to cancellation by throwing `CancellationError`.
/// The tasks must handle cancellation in some other way,
/// such as returning the work completed so far, returning an empty result, or returning `nil`.
/// For tasks that need to handle cancellation by throwing an error,
/// use the `withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup(returning:body:)` method instead.
///

///
/// Error Handling and Implicit Cancellation
/// ========================================
///
/// Since it is not possible to explicitly await individual task completions,
/// it is also not possible to "re-throw" an error thrown by one of the child
/// tasks using the same pattern as one would in a ``ThrowingTaskGroup``:
///
/// ```
/// // ThrowingTaskGroup, pattern not applicable to ThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup
/// try await withThrowingTaskGroup(of: Void.this) { group in
///   group.addTask { try boom() }
///   try await group.next() // re-throws "boom"
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Since discarding task groups don't have access to `next()`, this pattern
/// cannot be used.
/// Instead,
/// a *throwing discarding task group implicitly cancels itself whenever any
/// of its child tasks throws*.
///
/// The *first error* thrown inside such task group
/// is then retained and thrown
/// out of the `withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup` method when it returns.
///
/// ```
/// try await withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup { group in
///   group.addTask { try boom(1) }
///   group.addTask { try boom(2, after: .seconds(5)) }
///   group.addTask { try boom(3, after: .seconds(5)) }
/// }
/// ```
///
/// Generally, this suits the typical use cases of a
/// discarding task group well, however, if you want to prevent specific
/// errors from canceling the group you can catch them inside the child
/// task's body like this:
///
/// ```
/// try await withThrowingDiscardingTaskGroup { group in
///   group.addTask {
///     do {
///       try boom(1)
///     } catch is HarmlessError {
///       return
///     }
///   }
///   group.addTask {
///     try boom(2, after: .seconds(5))
///   }
