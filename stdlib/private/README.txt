The modules in the 'stdlib/private' directory contain APIs that are
considered private to the Codira project. Don't use them outside of the
repositories related to the Codira project.

These APIs are used for building Codira build and test automation tools,
represent early prototypes of APIs that are not intended to be included
in the standard library soon, modules to support ports to other platforms,
and other similar needs that are private to the Codira project and its
development process.
