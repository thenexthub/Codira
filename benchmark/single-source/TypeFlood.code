// We use this test to benchmark the runtime memory that Codira programs use.
//
// The Codira compiler caches the metadata that it needs to generate to support
// code that checks for protocol conformance and other operations that require
// use of metadata.
// This mechanism has the potential to allocate a lot of memory. This benchmark
// program generates 2^15 calls to language_conformsToProtocol and fills the
// metadata/conformance caches with data that we never free. We use this
// program to track the runtime memory usage of language programs. The test is
// optimized away in Release builds but kept in Debug mode.
